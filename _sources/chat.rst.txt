        Jasper Carpizo [10:23 AM]
        hi @dolita, ah yes, I will going to check the WMS-292 :wink: (edited)

        dolita [11:18 AM]
        jasper, if you havent heard (sorry it is abrupt), i will be here only until end of next week
        so ~these 2 weeks~ this week can you try to set aside some time so i can show you as much as possible? ^^ (edited)
        wait, shld be this week

        Jasper Carpizo [11:21 AM]
        :astonished:, I thought is until end of December.  Yes, I'll get to you tomorrow. :slightly_smiling_face: (edited)

        dolita [11:22 AM]
        yea management gave me another choice ytd, either 24 jan next year or 16 dec (my original plan). i cant stay so long, so 16 dec is my choice
        can you set aside some time today, going to show you omss (got 1 ticket pending)

        Jasper Carpizo [11:24 AM]
        mhm, yeah sure after lunch today.

        dolita [11:24 AM]
        as per original plan of mine, since 1 dec, you will take over manning OMSS (WMS support board) ^^
        okay

        Jasper Carpizo [11:35 AM]
        ah yes @dolita :slightly_smiling_face:

        Jasper Carpizo [1:52 PM]
        hi @dolita, let me know, if you are available :wink:

        dolita [1:54 PM]
        yep
        let's start then?
        i just added you to #wms_support channel. so when there is movement in OMSS, will get notification
        right now got 1 pending task (as you see ald)
        the background is like this
        when wh finished pick and pack, they found out there are shortage
        so we have to help them remove that from pick list
        it is kind of unofficial SOP
        and in new project like wing tai, we will not entertain that request

        Jasper Carpizo [1:57 PM]
        okay  got it

        dolita [1:58 PM]
        so the key is if got shortage & need to remove from pick list => we do
        if they want to add item into picklist => reject, ask them create new SO or so
        you understand the ticket?
        what you think shld be done?

        Jasper Carpizo [2:00 PM]
        yep, remove the items in the pick ticket PI2018-004915 under courex id 17952?

        dolita [2:00 PM]
        i actually got a script to do that easily
        coz it is not simply editing wms_picklist_item
        firstly can you go to that pick ticket in wms ?
        how you know which one nt picked?
        nice
        last time i removed pickpack_admin acl from your account (edited)
        can you add it back?

        Jasper Carpizo [2:04 PM]
        ah yes

        dolita [2:08 PM]
        refresh the pick ticket again
        dont have to update user ... coz yours not newly set
        anyway back to pick ticket
        thats refreshed?
        can check your ACL?
        is dev inside?
        cross check mine, UID 2202
        cross check with my ACL
        set dev to yours
        yep set your ACL, add dev ACL

        dolita [2:18 PM]
        backup wms_solist_item also
        then back to pick list page, at each line that hasnt been picked fully, click 'special remove' link

        Jasper Carpizo [2:21 PM]
        okay :slightly_smiling_face:

        dolita [2:21 PM]
        lol, can you open that file?
        in code
        check what permission is required
        got 2 solution for this
        1st one add your uid in whitelist
        2nd one remove that lines (and check acl instead)
        just know that that page is for dev only
        it is a series of queries
        i added so i can just click and get the job done lol
        which 1 you think better?

        Jasper Carpizo [2:26 PM]
        may I can use your account for temporary

        dolita [2:26 PM]
        maybe you want maintain 2 accounts
        1st one jasper (set it as non pickpack_admin)
        then 2nd one is for when you need do these things? (edited)
        you can rename user.Username when im gone

        Jasper Carpizo [2:27 PM]
        No, hehe

        dolita [2:27 PM]
        it is ok, better rename
        if not kind of funny to see my names "everywhere"
        look around top there
        you may want to add some kind of differentiator when accessing local-wms vs wms.courex next time (edited)
        you see 'create packing list'
        it means all items record picked successfully
        if still got unpicked, it will nt show
        there is only 1 issue with that special remove. that is if `wms_solist_item.list_itemqty` & `wms_solist_item.list_itemqtyout` not matching, it will go to error
        can you go to specialremove.php and search for the `list_itemqty`?
        if so_qty != so_qtyout
        it is some bug..
        so when you run special remove link, if you see that echo `!!!!...`
        just update so_qtyout to be same as so_qty
        (of course after you do some due diligence checks)

        Jasper Carpizo [2:37 PM]
        I noted, so I can review with this later

        dolita [2:37 PM]
        ok we are done with OMSS, see you tmr?
        rem change the status & update the ticket that it is done
        puah is the lady who sit beside me ytd
        she is the head of warehouse
        oh you know ald

        hehehe
        thanks a lot @dolita

        dolita [2:41 PM]

        Jasper Carpizo [2:41 PM]
        ah thank you :slightly_smiling_face:

        dolita [2:54 PM]
        btw you can change the status of OMSS-509 also
        now shld be in progress

        Jasper Carpizo [2:55 PM]
        start progress?

        dolita [2:55 PM]
        yup
        most of the support tasks are documented here over time: https://urbanfox.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/WMS/pages/14909441/WMS+Support+Tasks+for+Engineers (edited)
        if unfortunately not in the list, you can search past OMSS/WMS or try to look in the code (edited)

        Jasper Carpizo [2:58 PM]
        great! have some references. yeah, no worries. I'll search in the code if ever.

        dolita [2:58 PM]
        :+1::woman-bowing:

        Jasper Carpizo [2:58 PM]
        hehe.. Thanks a lot :wink: (edited)

        dolita [2:59 PM]
        ping me if you want me to review the PRs

        dolita [3:08 PM]
        btw jasper, puah's jira account got issue such that she is unable to see comments in all tickets (including the one she created)
        (thats why ytd i ask her find me)
        i just told her abt OMSS-509 via hangout. she said it is good, we can close it (edited)

        Jasper Carpizo [3:11 PM]
        hehe.. okay. So I can click the `Mark as Done` to close the ticket? (edited)

        dolita [3:12 PM]
        yup

        Jasper Carpizo [3:13 PM]
        Done :slightly_smiling_face:

        dolita [3:14 PM]
        nice

        dolita [4:29 PM]
        look like we can schedule some PR for next wed deployments
        (am i right?)
        it gonna be my last deployment. i shld be showing you as well

        Jasper Carpizo [4:31 PM]
        mhm, btw, any feedback about this one https://bitbucket.org/courex/courex-wms/pull-requests/94

        dolita [4:32 PM]
        i would like to merge the script with the one autocompleting wms account
        but then it is nt impt now. i wanted to _merge_ it myself but i think no more time. so just leave it alone. we can do other more critical tasks first (edited)
        so i guess it is good to go

        Jasper Carpizo [4:34 PM]
        understood :slightly_smiling_face:,  we can go to critical one.

        dolita [4:34 PM]
        yep
        so i think other than the dupe in pick list one, most of it are good. by tmr or day after tmr we will put in #wms list of PR to be scheduled for next wed deployment (edited)

        Jasper Carpizo [4:39 PM]
        ah yes.. :slightly_smiling_face:

        dolita [4:39 PM]
        :thumbsup:

        Jasper Carpizo [5:48 PM]
        hi @dolita, I have to go.

        dolita [5:48 PM]
        yep @Jasper Carpizo have good evening

        Jasper Carpizo [5:48 PM]
        you too @dolita, have a nice evening :slightly_smiling_face:

December 5, 2018

.. code-block:: console

        Jasper Carpizo [10:33 AM]
        hi @dolita, good morning.
        I have a question, on what page that I can find this issue `User can attempt to create duplicated receival from PO` ? (edited)

        dolita [10:34 AM]
        morning Jasper

        Jasper Carpizo [10:34 AM]
        :wink:

        dolita [10:35 AM]
        the PRs all settled? including duplicate pick ticket?

        Jasper Carpizo [10:35 AM]
        ah not yet :grimacing:

        dolita [10:35 AM]
        oh ok just asking
        it is good time to show you inbound

        Jasper Carpizo [10:37 AM]
        ah yes.. upon checking the task that I assigned to me. I just look the inbound but after have idea for it. I just continue working some PR's :slightly_smiling_face:

        dolita [10:37 AM]
        yep no worries
        lets talk abt inbound then?

        Jasper Carpizo [10:37 AM]
        ah yes :wink:

        dolita [10:37 AM]
        so inbound is what is under `Purchasing` tab
        the main activity in inbound is `to receive`, so the main feature is `GR` (goods receiving)
        and those receiving are listed under `GRN` (goods receiving note)
        with GRN, we have 3 main ways.. 1) GRN with PO, 2) GRN w/o PO (list the items then select and do GRN), 3) GRN w/o PO scan (scan barcode directly)
        shld i continue or it is easier for you to find out yourself?

        Jasper Carpizo [10:41 AM]
        ah yes, just continue, so I  have an idea

        dolita [10:42 AM]
        i feel like before i talk abt inbound, i need to talk about inventory first

        Jasper Carpizo [10:43 AM]
        ah okay, hehe.., sure we can discuss first the inventory

        dolita [10:43 AM]
        ok
        what is the diff itemmaster vs inventory?

        Jasper Carpizo [10:45 AM]
        item master =  all the product list , inventory =  numbers of items / product are available. (edited)

        dolita [10:45 AM]
        ok
        so inventory is the stock level ie how many units of that SKU _stored_ in warehouse
        but there are some specifications in inventory
        1) location, 2) expiry date, 3) serialised vs non-serialised items, 4) creation date, 5) last picked date
        i think 1,2,4,5 are self-described (i.e. you see the words, you know what it is ald) (edited)
        am i right?

        Jasper Carpizo [10:48 AM]
        ah yes

        dolita [10:49 AM]
        you want try explain to me?

        Jasper Carpizo [10:51 AM]
        on our warehouse, I saw the the label of SKU, so its the `location` right ? (edited)

        dolita [10:51 AM]
        label of SKU?

        Jasper Carpizo [10:53 AM]
        correct me I'm wrong, because saw in the warehouse, have some little label

        dolita [10:54 AM]
        label at where? the boxes?
        or racks? what is the label like?

        Jasper Carpizo [10:54 AM]
        on the racks

        dolita [10:54 AM]
        the one i pointed?

        Jasper Carpizo [10:54 AM]
        yes

        dolita [10:55 AM]
        when we going inside?
        yep that is _location_

        Jasper Carpizo [10:55 AM]
        yes, I remembered you said the SKU
        hehehe

        dolita [10:55 AM]
        i can create location like `jasper` and it also is a _location_
        hmmm
        SKU is.. the itemmaster identification
        pretty sure i wont refer to rack label as SKU

        Jasper Carpizo [10:56 AM]
        ah okay, maybe I wrong, hehe.. but its a location of an items (edited)

        dolita [10:56 AM]
        yep
        location of a SKU also correct
        but location != SKU
        you want to continue 2, 4, 5?

        Jasper Carpizo [10:57 AM]
        ah yes, noted.
        expiry date,  = item expiration date
        serialised =  is the one we can scan, correct me if I am wrong ah

        dolita [10:59 AM]
        well

        Jasper Carpizo [10:59 AM]
        non-serialised =  we can pack directly

        dolita [10:59 AM]
        i think i only say 1,2,4,5 ^^

        Jasper Carpizo [11:00 AM]
        ops, hehehe
        yep, the creation date of the items,  and datetime the last picked on an item

        dolita [11:02 AM]
        it is creation date of inventory
        in this context, item is nt inventory
        lets say on monday yanyan create SKU called `SKU-12345`. the creation date of this item = 3 dec 2018
        then today the item come, so i do receival of `1 PIECE` into location `L2M`, what is the creation date of this item? it is still 3 dec 2018 (edited)
        but what is the creation date of this _inventory_? it is today, 5 dec
        when you are asked what is the inventory of `SKU-12345` now? the ans is there is `1 piece in L2M, creation date 5 dec 2018`

        Jasper Carpizo [11:05 AM]
        what is L2M?

        dolita [11:05 AM]
        location

        Jasper Carpizo [11:06 AM]
        its still  3 dec 2018

        dolita [11:07 AM]
        ?
        you mean im wrong and the creation date of inventory is 3 dec 2018?

        Jasper Carpizo [11:08 AM]
        Nope, the creation date is dec 5, 2018
        hehe

        dolita [11:08 AM]
        ok. you mean `creation date of item` is still 3 dec 2018?
        anyway the database helps to visualise this
        so no worries ^^

        Jasper Carpizo [11:09 AM]
        ah, okay, hehe..   Its dec 5,
        because its a first creation of an inventory

        dolita [11:10 AM]
        yep
        prolly more correct to say "creation date of that inventory record"
        shall we continue, #3, serialised vs non-serialised items?

        Jasper Carpizo [11:11 AM]
        ah yes

        dolita [11:11 AM]
        some items have to be stored with their serial number
        such as phone, washing machine
        serial number is a very unique identifier for 1 single unit
        which means if i have 10 phones, and i want it tracked in the serial number, there will be 10 lines of inventory record
        because each quantity has different serial (in phone it is IMEI)

        Jasper Carpizo [11:12 AM]
        ah yes

        dolita [11:13 AM]
        but people can also opt to track the inventory as non-serial. so to apply non-serial example to the phone,
        the inventory record will be 1 line of qty = 10

        Jasper Carpizo [11:14 AM]
        ah okay

        dolita [11:14 AM]
        how do we know if the item has to be tracked as serialised? check the `wms_itemmaster.item_snbound` flag
        if it is 1 == manage this SKU's inventory as serialised items
        and the serial number is stored in `wms_sn` table which is linked to `wms_inventory.serial_id`
        ok so far?

        Jasper Carpizo [11:16 AM]
        ah yes, got it

        dolita [11:17 AM]
        ok, so lets go back to inbound
        https://urbanfox.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/WMS/pages/22249473/WMS+Features
        search for `Goods Receiving`
        i have listed the 4 main methods of GR, the last one is `Goods Receiving without PO (serialised item)`
        so note that.. serialised item has their own receiving page and they should nt be received using the regular non serialised GRN page
        remember that day we go to warehouse
        zaid was doing receival of headphones
        ?

        Jasper Carpizo [11:20 AM]
        ah yes, the two headphones

        dolita [11:20 AM]
        yep. those headphones are tracked/managed/stored with their serial number
        so he was using this page (note: this is staging version of the page he use): https://wms-stag.courex.com.sg/wms/manualreceivescan_customsn.php (edited)
        i think you are lucky to come when they are processing serialised item
        also note that when we do picking of serial items, what we scan is the serial number, not the item barcode

        Jasper Carpizo [11:23 AM]
        ah yes, this is noted.

        dolita [11:23 AM]
        nice

        Jasper Carpizo [11:25 AM]
        this I remembered,, they actually scan the serial number, have printed the serial number, after that she passed to the other person with printed serial to packed the item (edited)

        dolita [11:25 AM]
        what she print is the receiver address label actually
        and connote of delivery

        Jasper Carpizo [11:26 AM]
        ah okay, got it. thanks for correct me :slightly_smiling_face:

        dolita [11:26 AM]
        :thumbsup:
        you feel like having another trip to warehouse? lol
        just asking..
        so do you think you know WMS-300 ald or it is better if i talk about it?
        (coz i think i nv talk about PO also)
        sorry give me 5 mins break :blush:

        Jasper Carpizo [11:30 AM]
        ah sure :wink:  you already done to discussed the inventory.

        dolita [11:30 AM]
        yep

        dolita [11:56 AM]
        we continue about the PO after lunch?

        Jasper Carpizo [11:56 AM]
        ah yes :wink:

        dolita [11:56 AM]
        unless you dont need me to go through

        Jasper Carpizo [11:56 AM]
        after lunch, hehe

        dolita [11:56 AM]
        lol ok

        Jasper Carpizo [12:29 PM]
        lunch?

        dolita [2:00 PM]
        shall we talk abt PO now?

        Jasper Carpizo [2:00 PM]
        ah yes :slightly_smiling_face:

        dolita [2:00 PM]
        actually nt as long as earlier
        but it is fine
        i can show how to reproduce the duplicates
        https://urbanfox.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/WMS/pages/222920746/WMS+Dictionary
        show you what i wrote abt PO earlier lol
        so people usually pair PO and SO
        PO is the order we create when we want to bring goods into inventory
        so for WMS-300, can you open wms-stag?
        or your local-wms
        then go to times
        this also can
        got 1 open PO
        duplicated
        well user dont normally do what we do just now
        but when network bad, or laggy, they can also accidentally click twice
        (you try click twice)
        i nv able to reproduce the twice clicking prob
        coz nv click fast enough
        this is purchase order
        when goods come, we click go to receiving to receive it
        but got 1 more way to do so
        that is the same form from where we click "go to goods receiving" (compare the URL)
        both go to same page

        Jasper Carpizo [2:10 PM]
        ah yes

        dolita [2:10 PM]
        pls continue your testing hehe
        btw when i left, you shld rename 2202 user.username and change the password (and maybe let nizam you changed ald) (edited)
        coz if nt when nizam do clean up, he will list my account for cleaning lol
        altho if he list my account for cleaning.. you can still put back the stuffs

        Jasper Carpizo [2:14 PM]
        yeah, noted @dolita :cry:

        dolita [2:15 PM]
        dun be sad

        Jasper Carpizo [2:16 PM]
        yep, hehe

        Jasper Carpizo [3:34 PM]
        hi @dolita, the `Reference DO#` = `list_Reference` , is the unique one right? (edited)

        dolita [3:36 PM]
        in GRN, it is nt unique
        actually quite a lot GRN use same reference DO# (/ `list_Reference`)
        :point_up_2: if im nt wrong
        and actually in SO it is also not enforced. only when we do upload then enforced

        Jasper Carpizo [3:38 PM]
        ah because the `list_ReferenceMisc` is have some empty. mhm, I'll check the diagram :slightly_smiling_face:

        dolita [3:41 PM]
        ya `list_ReferenceMist` is optional
        if you looking to stop duplicate, shld cross check PO
        remember we cannot receive more than what is listed in PO
        btw there is a support ticket OMSS-511
        are you able to take care of it?
        the requester is danielle
        nikki talked to me, she said danielle has UF DP account (but she nv give us the account) :thinking_face:

        Jasper Carpizo [3:43 PM]
        ah yes I can take care (edited)

        dolita [3:43 PM]
        maybe you add nikki as participant
        ask them to give

        Jasper Carpizo [3:43 PM]
        yep, I just wondering, because she needs to register to UF DP

        dolita [3:44 PM]
        danielle want full access, we will give her all WMS ACL except `wms_pickpack_admin` (nobody shld have that except warehouse/operation head like qiuling/ david) (edited)
        btw nikki passed the account ald
        tell her dont have that username, and tell her what usernames are there
        actually shld reply in ticket
        but up to you
        there're 3 emails
        eh wait
        shld say "username" (edited)
        `there're have 3 username` i thought shld be `there're 3 username`? (edited)

        Jasper Carpizo [3:58 PM]
        ahaha.. sorry

        dolita [3:58 PM]
        no worries
        sometime on some day they will msgs and go pushy (edited)
        you shld try to remain calm and dont get affected

        Jasper Carpizo [3:59 PM]
        ah yes.. hehe

        dolita [3:59 PM]
        those ppl ah..

        Jasper Carpizo [3:59 PM]
        actually, I have grammar error, hehee

        dolita [3:59 PM]
        everything also urgent.. but it is nt really urgent
        still can edit
        but email sent out ald
        and if anyone ask you to do support directly (either hangout or slack or email)
        ask them to create JIRA ticket in OMSS
        tht is our SOP

        Jasper Carpizo [4:00 PM]
        yes, noted.

        dolita [4:01 PM]
        like ty said if they cant even take time to create JIRA, maybe their issue not worth our care?

        Jasper Carpizo [4:01 PM]
        just like De Silva, but I didn't notice, she have some message to me.

        dolita [4:01 PM]
        but there are real urgent cases that affect operations/ very critical
        is she also philipino?
        frm the name?
        lol ok
        another thing, dont need call us sir & madam

        Jasper Carpizo [4:02 PM]
        hahahah..
        okay :wink:

        dolita [4:03 PM]
        see, they go pushy but once we replied, nobody reply
        sian right..
        lol

        Jasper Carpizo [4:03 PM]
        ahhaha

        dolita [4:04 PM]
        you know sian mean what?

        Jasper Carpizo [4:04 PM]
        no

        dolita [4:04 PM]
        oh ok
        kind of mean 'tired and boring' in this case it is 'annoyed & tired'

        Jasper Carpizo [4:05 PM]
        yep, ahhaha

        dolita [4:05 PM]
        anyway i think while waiting you can create the CALL first?
        then later add in the UID?
        the CALL SP queries
        btw also maybe we also need ping nikki to tell her abt the prob
        `sian /sien, sɪɛn/ a. [Hk., bored, depressed, in low spirits; Mand. 闷 mèn]  1 Bored, fed-up, tired.` lol

        `all problem solver` got everything
        that is _all_ access to WMS (edited)
        look like i shld redo the table lol
        problem solver also has picpack_admin acl
        the next after it is the one we shld have given to most ppl
        this is 'all' access
        but most time users need tell us which account they want to clone

        Jasper Carpizo [4:15 PM]
        maybe I will asked first what user they follow.

        dolita [4:15 PM]
        yep normally need ask
        but danielle here request for full access (edited)

        Jasper Carpizo [4:16 PM]
        so I can check the user ACL they followed
        ah okay

        dolita [4:16 PM]
        so full access constitute what you noted down

        Jasper Carpizo [4:17 PM]
        except for `wms_pickpack_admin`

        dolita [4:17 PM]
        lol it is my stubborness
        you can do what you deem right actually

        dolita [4:27 PM]
        sorry to disturb @Jasper Carpizo, i have updated the ACL notes. hopefully it is clearer now

        Jasper Carpizo [4:29 PM]
        ah thank you @dolita, very much helpful.

        dolita [4:29 PM]
        nice, thanks @Jasper Carpizo
        btw i will be on leave on 10th

        Jasper Carpizo [4:31 PM]
        ah noted but you'll be here in Tuesday to Friday?

        dolita [4:31 PM]
        yup
        dont worry feel free to disturb me on monday

        Jasper Carpizo [4:31 PM]
        :slightly_smiling_face:
        hehehee

        dolita [4:31 PM]
        im likely going out but  can type on phone ^^ (edited)
        tbh i think sat sun you also can msg me. since technically 16th is my last

        Jasper Carpizo [4:33 PM]
        ah sure, hehe

        Jasper Carpizo [4:48 PM]
        hi @dolita, I've got replied from nikki.
        daniella using gmail account :wink:
        I'm currently applying her access now

        dolita [4:48 PM]
        :thumbsup:
        okay

        Jasper Carpizo [5:00 PM]
        @dolita, nikki, message me about resetting password for Daniella

        dolita [5:00 PM]
        ok

        Jasper Carpizo [5:01 PM]
        I think there's an option UF DB to reset the password right?

        dolita [5:01 PM]
        https://login.storeviva.com/
        click forget password
        then enter danielle email
        and ask nikki to check with danielle if she receive any forget password email (edited)
        actually
        you shld ask nikki to reply in OMSS
        cause our time have to be accounted
        if you have to spend long time to do support, you need to at least show that
        tell nikki that as well if you want. all BA shld know that (edited)

        Jasper Carpizo [5:04 PM]
        btw Raj, I have a question to me..

        dolita [5:05 PM]
        oh what is it?

        Jasper Carpizo [5:06 PM]
        he said, when an order created and pushed to TMS, we are required to have a delivery date?

        dolita [5:06 PM]
        we always give delivery date :slightly_smiling_face:

        Jasper Carpizo [5:06 PM]
        ah okay. :wink:

        dolita [5:07 PM]
        dont really understand the concern though
        cause all the TMS order created from legacy got delivery date
        WMS use legacy API to create and that one gt delivery date
        oh ya btw
        if we go to https://dp.urbanfox.asia/ and click login
        dp.urbanfox.asia
        Home
        Home
        that is the same link i pass you earlier: https://urbanfox-asia.slack.com/archives/DDVEYTZ1S/p1544000481115200 (edited)
        WMS and TMS share same user base, so they can reset forgotten password there

        Jasper Carpizo [5:17 PM]
        noted @dolita
        I'll try to confirm Raj question to me.

        dolita [5:18 PM]
        :thumbsup:

        Jasper Carpizo [5:37 PM]
        hi @dolita, I have to go. Its okay ? hehe

        dolita [5:37 PM]
        yep
        have good evening @Jasper Carpizo

        Jasper Carpizo [5:38 PM]
        ah thank you :wink:

        dolita [5:38 PM]
        hehe

        Jasper Carpizo [5:38 PM]
        Thanks a lot, have a nice evening too :relaxed:

        morning @Jasper Carpizo. have you seen OMSS-513?

        Jasper Carpizo [10:08 AM]
        ah yes, I'm currently replying because there's no username with the given username. I pushly they need to sign-up to this link https://dp.urbanfox.asia/delivery-person/signup before I setup the user acl. (edited)

        yep nice :thumbsup:
        btw i notice the danielle gmail account actually not signed up from that link
        (i think i need to brief you about users account)
        let me know when you are available :laughing:

        Jasper Carpizo [10:10 AM]
        ah yes, hehehe..

        Jasper Carpizo [10:26 AM]
        hi @dolita, can we create a dashboard that can search an username and then setup the User ACL, so we do not query directly to the mysql client. What do you think?

        dolita [10:27 AM]
        TMS is doing that dashboard
        you try ask them whats the progress?
        or rather
        ask them if they doing that dashboard
        wait ah
        https://bitbucket.org/courex/storeviva-dp/pull-requests/1000/20181114-manage-user-acl-page/diff#comment-84109114

        dolita [10:36 AM]
        the item barcode not filled
        they shld fill it
        they want us to give them _admin acl because their products dont have barcode or what not (edited)
        i feel like not so proper because whole warehouse are forced to enter barcode
        what i just show you is how the pick ticket should be used
        so you can show nikki with barcode, that is how pick ticket work
        after it is scanned, we actually can edit the qty
        refresh
        scan barcode
        if they are pickpack_admin doesnt need barcode, can just enter qty like my account
        i actually removed that from myself for a while cause majority users are not pickpack_admin
        there is a reason for having that constraint
        it is to ensure correct picking of item
        did she ask for the pickpack_admin acl?
        ok then dont need tell her that hehe
        coz nt fully picked yet
        ya they cant scan. we just added the barcode (need show her that)
        i mean just now no barcode right, we just added it
        in item master
        btw i wonder how she picked 4 units? if no barcode
        i see wrong
        nothing is picked
        if you click `record pick` now, ltr cant show her how pick ticket work? (edited)

        Jasper Carpizo [10:54 AM]
        its okay lah, hehee

        dolita [10:55 AM]
        haha good good
        did you guys talk about pickpack_admin?
        shall i bring it up to #wms that most users will not get pickpack_admin?

        Jasper Carpizo [10:58 AM]
        nope, I discussed a regular user, how can they directly to packlist, but I mention its an option to fill-up the item sku in inventory, if she can't scan the barcode.

        dolita [10:58 AM]
        oh ok
        when i introduce wms from beginning
        i shld have shown that (lol)
        but coz fellow dev, i just use the easy way to show
        shown the having to scan barcode in pick ticket i mean
        if im showing to regular user, that is what i will show (scan barcode first)

        Jasper Carpizo [11:02 AM]
        hehehe.. maybe I can mention to her later. about this one. btw, she asked what is `SO Remarks (for WMS only)` is for?

        dolita [11:02 AM]
        mention what to her?
        so there are 3 Remarks boxes in WMS
        `Remarks (Additional Shipping Instruction)` == the remarks that get carried forward to TMS
        `SO Remarks (for WMS only)` == the remarks that will stay in WMS, eg "pack with bubble wrap"
        both of them are visible to clients
        `SO Admin Note (not visible to WMS Customers)`  == the remarks for internal ops usage

        Jasper Carpizo [11:07 AM]
        got it :wink:

        dolita [11:07 AM]
        the remarks are explained briefly in https://urbanfox.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/WMS/pages/222920746/WMS+Dictionary (edited)
        you can pass this dictionary to nikki as well
        i always pass it around lol
        it is good for tech ppl (and nikki is part of tech)
        btw what you going to mention to Nikki?

        Jasper Carpizo [11:10 AM]
        I mean, I'll mention, if she ask me about the pick pack admin. (edited)

        dolita [11:11 AM]
        oh
        shall i bring it up at #wms ?

        Jasper Carpizo [11:12 AM]
        I think yes, if she have some question in WMS

        dolita [11:13 AM]
        ok

        Jasper Carpizo [11:15 AM]
        hehehe.. no update in https://urbanfox.atlassian.net/browse/OMSS-513

        dolita [11:16 AM]
        lol ya. i am also nt sure

        Jasper Carpizo [11:19 AM]
        ahhahha...
        wait, I will ask

        dolita [11:19 AM]

        Pasted image at 2018-12-06, 11:20 AM

        but best to ask
        btw jasper
        if BA/ users ask for any new features
        always consult ty
        he is the WMS solution architect

        Jasper Carpizo [11:21 AM]
        ah yes, this is noted Its our master :wink: (edited)
        hehehe

        dolita [11:21 AM]
        lol yup
        i wanted to stay until master come back
        but not my call
        sorry for that
        going to have to manage with master being remote for now (edited)

        Jasper Carpizo [11:22 AM]
        hehehe..  ah yes.
        also you are master too.
        hehehe

        dolita [11:23 AM]
        lol
        just in wms
        i need to show you more things :grimacing:

        Jasper Carpizo [11:23 AM]
        ah yes..
        maybe we can discuss after lunch, what do you think?

        dolita [11:24 AM]
        yep it is good
        btw do you want to select PRs for deployments?
        thinking tues deployment

        Jasper Carpizo [11:27 AM]
        I'll review first, maybe tomorrow I can decide which PR are okay, ehhee.. its okay to you?

        dolita [11:34 AM]
        yup it is ok
        if it helps, we will talk about the `things` tmr
        btw sorry to interrupt. last night raj asked me about the delivery date
        he asked you about it, but he realise he also need the pick up date

        Jasper Carpizo [11:37 AM]
        ah, okay, ehehe..
        I think, he already okay now.

        dolita [11:38 AM]
        ```Raj [6:28 PM]
        So I wanted know if the customers provide the pickup date when they create orders from WMS?
        Actually Jasper asked you about the delivery date, but i needed both the delivery date as well as the pickup date.
        dolita [6:30 PM]
        usually no. but the goods are stored in warehouse, so what warehouse ops do is select today as pick up and select delivery as per agreement
        i see
        when TMS order created from WMS --> TMS, they always have delivery date
        so i told him im nt sure whats the concern
        if there is issue, maybe you let me know which OL/ML?
        cause some customers have different processing
        Raj [6:32 PM]
        No, we don't have any issue.
        We are building a new billing portal, hence we want to make sure we are capturing everything right.
        dolita [6:32 PM]
        ah ok
        there are 2 ways WMS --> TMS can happen
        1) via WMS interface, which I just described
        2) via so-sync script, which is an automated script
        (a moment please while i check)
        Raj [6:34 PM]
        Sure
        dolita [6:36 PM]
        so in the automated script, the pickup date default to the date the process initiated
        delivery date is 1) if it is provided in SO, use it, 2) if not provided, it will be next working day```
        (edited)
        ya just want to update you what happening
        hopefully the above is clear (that is wall of text)

        Jasper Carpizo [11:41 AM]
        yep, that's clear. :wink: Thank you @dolita (edited)

        Jasper Carpizo [5:48 PM]

        hi yes, good morning..
        ah yes, just checking the task only but I'm currently working on some PR's

        this is what i have to brief you
        - (briefed until TMS) SO - Pick - Pack - TMS/ Self-collect/ Others - RMA

        - portal.storeviva.com
        - singhealth
        - so-sync (also known as so-processor) nodejs script (edited)
        wait.. lol

        Jasper Carpizo [9:43 AM]
        ah yes, noted. :wink:

        dolita [9:43 AM]
        there are still portal.storeviva.com
        singhealth
        the nodejs scripts (ty/ tms taking care of it temporarily but you shld know)
        WMS-201 is about adjustment, so i will be touching that feature soon
        although i probably will not talk about the task
        but i want you to know that there are a lot to brief and i am not sure how you can take it
        looking at your PO PR
        i already said that is not correct. not sure why you still go on to do like that
        your focus now should be knowing how WMS work
        (and we still need to clear all your outstanding PRs...)

        Jasper Carpizo [9:47 AM]
        ah yes, I'm wrong with that. I actually pushing the reference id to be unique to fill-up the field.

        dolita [9:47 AM]
        you cant change that cause it is not supposed to be unique
        once you push that change, consider what going to happen?
        if people used to reuse the reference id for several GRN, then they suddenly cant do that, they will surely find you
        anyway you see from my list, which one you ald confident?
        i have briefed some of them..
        this list.. https://urbanfox-asia.slack.com/archives/DDVEYTZ1S/p1544146944003800

        Jasper Carpizo [9:57 AM]
        ah yes..
        sorry :grimacing:

        dolita [9:58 AM]
        updated the list, see if you agree

        Jasper Carpizo [9:59 AM]
        regarding with your list

        dolita [10:02 AM]
        and i have to write some documents about some apps (where they are and brief description of the usage). will pass to you asap..
        so do you think we still need to work on WMS-201?

        Jasper Carpizo [10:04 AM]
        I confident with the following list
        - (briefed) Overview of specs of inventory: serialised and non-serialised items, location, expiry date, creation date, last picked date
        - (briefed) User ACL
        - (briefed) GRN for serialised items/ Picking for serialised items
        - (briefed) RN w PO/ GRN without PO/ GRN without PO (scanning)
        to be honest, I need some recap of the following
        - (briefed until TMS) SO - Pick - Pack - TMS/ Self-collect/ Others - RMA
        - (briefed) RN w PO/ GRN without PO/ GRN without PO (scanning)
        - (partly briefed) Item master - Inventory
        - Adjustment/ Main adjustment

        dolita [10:09 AM]
        nah i dont mind if that helps

        you should bug me while im still here too

        you notice puah nv give account she want to clone (ACL) for the 3 new users? (edited)

        Jasper Carpizo [10:31 AM]
        ah yes, I need to check the pual  acl and applied same acl with 3 new users.

        dolita [10:32 AM]
        no
        puah shld say the 3 need to follow who

        Jasper Carpizo [10:35 AM]
        ah okay, I will ask puah, what user should be follow,

        Jasper Carpizo [10:40 AM]
        hi @dolita, nizam asked me about the production server, this the name of our prod server right wms.courex.com.sg also he request me about the public key ? Do we have?

        dolita [10:42 AM]
        i think he mean you need to access production server and he asking you for your public key
        our access to (legacy) servers are regulated using SSH public private key
        you need to generate your own key and pass nizam the public one
        keep the private one yourself

        Jasper Carpizo [10:44 AM]
        the one that I generated in my butbucket?

        dolita [10:45 AM]
        and nope, that is not access to wms.courex.com.sg ... after you settled these, i will be able to show you where to login to access some other apps
        like this one is it https://bitbucket.org/account/user/<your account>/ssh-keys/ ?
        https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/set-up-an-ssh-key-728138079.html
        i think yes
        but im nt sure if it is alright to reuse that same key pair
        you shld have SSH set in your machine i think

        Jasper Carpizo [10:47 AM]
        how about this one
        ```how abt ec2?
        i means servers?```
        he asked me about this things?
        name of our production server that we used.

        dolita [10:49 AM]
        oh
        you need access to...
        ```sv-production-bastion
        sv-production-app-storeviva
        sv-production-app-internal```

        Jasper Carpizo [10:52 AM]
        this is our servers?

        dolita [10:52 AM]
        actually i think only need to set your key at sv-production-bastion
        it is servers for legacy stuffs...
        wms itself is in beanstalk

        Jasper Carpizo [10:54 AM]
        so I'll told to nizam this servers,

        sv-production-bastion
        sv-production-app-storeviva
        sv-production-app-internal

        and say, I have no ssh access for this servers? (edited)

        dolita [10:56 AM]
        i actually not sure what is the original qn?

        Screenshot from 2018-12-07 10-57-05.png


        dolita [10:58 AM]
        ok tell him that 3

        Jasper Carpizo [10:59 AM]
        okay, thanks because I'm unsure.

        dolita [10:59 AM]
        + beanstalk of courex-wms? (edited)

        Jasper Carpizo [10:59 AM]
        ??

        dolita [11:00 AM]
        his qn is which servers in production you will access
        we have legacies EC2 that is managed via SSH inside
        ```sv-production-app-storeviva
        sv-production-app-internal```
        and to access those 2, must go via `sv-production-bastion`
        and we have wms.courex.com.sg which is in beanstalk
        im not sure if his qn also mean the beanstalks

        Jasper Carpizo [11:04 AM]
        ah okay, got it.

        dolita [11:17 AM]
        i think i need to show you the user-staffs db.. -.-

        Jasper Carpizo [11:18 AM]
        ah yeah sure

        dolita [11:19 AM]
        nah it is ok
        i will pass you some query first

        dolita [11:24 AM]
        ```SELECT user.*, staffs.StaffID, staffs.courex_uid FROM user LEFT JOIN staffs ON staffs.courex_uid = user.UID WHERE staffs.StaffID = 724916```
        (edited)
        is it clear?
        but i notice puah gave 3 ppl ID. 1st one she gave the staffID, 2nd & 3rd one is the user.UID

        Jasper Carpizo [11:31 AM]
        ah okay, got it. the missing username is on the staffs table (edited)
        but why?

        dolita [11:32 AM]
        username is in user table

        Jasper Carpizo [11:33 AM]
        yeah, i mean have separated table?

        dolita [11:35 AM]
        when we register from https://dp.urbanfox.asia/delivery-person/signup 3 records are created in 3 tables, ie `user`, `staffs`, `mobiledevice`
        dp.urbanfox.asia
        Urbanfox DP Signup
        Urbanfox DP Signup
        user & staffs are linked like my query
        so in the past we always refer to staffs users by their staffs.StaffID (edited)
        but over time, we only use `user` table primarily (edited)
        so there are 2 things you can do
        1) is standardise. eg if people give you staffID, ask for their UID / username instead (edited)
        or 2) you try search the info yourself

        Jasper Carpizo [11:43 AM]
        okay, got it. :slightly_smiling_face:

        dolita [11:44 AM]
        not sure if you remember but i mentioned danielle `user` does not have `staffs` counterpart
        hmm ok nvm im wrong

        Jasper Carpizo [11:46 AM]
        ah okay, I'm checking the https://urbanfox.atlassian.net/browse/OMSS-511

        dolita [11:47 AM]
        yep
        i search the username and found the UID
        then do `SELECT staffs.StaffID, staffs.courex_uid, staffs.Email FROM user LEFT JOIN staffs ON staffs.courex_uid = user.UID WHERE user.UID = 16199`
        i thought i will see null, but actually got correct entries there
        so i was wrong lol

        Jasper Carpizo [11:49 AM]
        btw, can you help me, what nizam referring , is he needs my private ssh that I created in my bitbucket account or the ssh key in our server.
        Screenshot from 2018-12-07 11-48-22.png


        dolita [11:50 AM]
        he need your public key
        you shld nv give ppl your private key

        Jasper Carpizo [11:50 AM]
        yeah my ssh public key

        dolita [11:50 AM]
        just give him your public key will do
        he will add your key to bastion

        Jasper Carpizo [11:52 AM]
        I think we can't reuse the ssh public key.

        dolita [11:53 AM]
        then you got to create new one
        and manage 2 keys in your machine
        can i talk abt this in the channel with @ty ? (edited)

        Jasper Carpizo [11:55 AM]
        ah sure.. to our lord master lol.. (edited)

        if that is WMS-->TMS, they need to enable the `Enable External Tracking

        Posted in #tmsDec 7thView message
        i think this is a feature i talk until my mouth foaming but nobody _know_ abt it lol
        altho i told ops side once and they nv ask me abt it again

        Jasper Carpizo [2:49 PM]
        hi @dolita, can we create a model folder for using table queries for now we have different queries in the different files, so we can manage the queries.. or do you have some suggestion or separated file? (edited)

        dolita [2:50 PM]
        that time master talked abt it
        wait ah
        https://urbanfox.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/WMS/pages/55312442/Roadmap+WMS
        2018-Q4-2
        basically we will create a folder + files for queries
        i ald started
        `wms/data_access/outbound_query.php`
        (is that what u mean?)

        Jasper Carpizo [2:52 PM]
        ah yes, :slightly_smiling_face:

        dolita [2:52 PM]
        so my thinking is, `outbound_query`, `inbound_query`, `inventory_query`

        Jasper Carpizo [2:53 PM]
        so we can call the function only instead directly on the php files.

        dolita [2:53 PM]
        yup
        and over time the data_access will be replaced with wms api
        meaning inside the functions, instead of direct queries, it will be API call (edited)
        we wont need to change the code, just the functions
        lol that is frm aug/ sept
        and until now i only managed to add that (and forgot about it ald :disappointed: )
        but im kinda sure the data_access is 1 of the way, moving forward. do talk to ty abt it when he is back (edited)

        Jasper Carpizo [2:57 PM]
        ah yes, just like MVC framework.

        dolita [2:58 PM]
        yup

        Jasper Carpizo [2:58 PM]
        also all logical function should be on controller and separated to the model queries.

        dolita [2:59 PM]
        do it step by step ^^
        before you change anything, make sure you know how everything works first

        Jasper Carpizo [3:01 PM]
        I can create one today, I just rewriting the queries report_transhistory.php because I noticed when fetch all the records with jquerys, its a kinda a laggy to search the user.

        dolita [3:02 PM]
        ok
        add jira task for that?
        lets talk to ty abt the controller?

        Jasper Carpizo [3:02 PM]
        ah yes
        btw, I just improving the https://bitbucket.org/courex/courex-wms/pull-requests/94
        I just tested so I notice that

        dolita [3:03 PM]
        coz need to ensure the changes fit the big picture
        oh lol
        do note though as you add these, set aside some time to listen to my boring talks abt WMS & cronies :laughing:

        Jasper Carpizo [3:07 PM]
        ah what do you mean cronies, my vocabulary is limited, ahahaha

        dolita [3:08 PM]

        hahaha

        dolita [3:09 PM]
        wms & friends i guess
        the other day i said `cheryl & co` and gisha thought i mean a company
        when it is actually cheryl & friends. the `co` here is like donald & co
        from disney. but seems like nt popular term :grimacing:

        Jasper Carpizo [3:13 PM]
        ahhaha.. got it

        dolita [3:13 PM]
        jasper, the `Enable External Tracking` is disabled by default
        people need to enable it, eg if they create new account (edited)
        you know right?

        Jasper Carpizo [3:13 PM]
        ah yes

        dolita [3:14 PM]
        you understand what it is for?

        Jasper Carpizo [3:15 PM]
        nope.
        did you already discussed or I forgot?

        dolita [3:16 PM]
        i discussed
        ok
        so if it is enabled, when user create TMS order from packing list, the `SO Reference` will be used as TMS external tracking
        if nt enabled, then no external tracking

        Jasper Carpizo [3:18 PM]
        can you show me, how its works? Can I seat beside you?

        dolita [3:18 PM]
        yup
        come

        dolita [3:25 PM]
        that is hold stock feature
        i picked from L4-RM4 so after record pick, qty deducted by 1, and hold stock removed

        Jasper Carpizo [3:28 PM]
        this weekend, I need to revire all of things so we can discussed and create a list of question. So we can discuss by Tuesday

        dolita [3:28 PM]
        you mean sat sun mon you revise?

        Jasper Carpizo [3:29 PM]
        I mean review all things you brief to me
        and just create a list of question. so I'm ready to have question for you bt tueday
        for now, I just working the PR's

        dolita [3:30 PM]
        haven show you that enable thing

        Jasper Carpizo [3:30 PM]
        tracking number

        dolita [3:30 PM]
        lol

        Jasper Carpizo [3:35 PM]
        the first discussion ahahah

        dolita [3:35 PM]
        ya, xinyun also got do that
        in wh trip
        nt sure if you got access to dp-stag.urbanfox.asia
        if not, either copy the acl yrself (it is same field) or ask tms folks help

        Jasper Carpizo [3:40 PM]
        let me check again the diffrence the tracking number givem

        dolita [3:41 PM]
        i created when the option is enabled then the SO ref got carried forward
        then i disabled that settings and create another one, this time my SO ref got ignored

        Jasper Carpizo [3:43 PM]
        got it :wink:

        dolita [3:43 PM]
        it is settings that only work at WMS
        if people use the so-processor-script (so-sync) the SO reference always carried to TMS as external tracking
        so-sync is automated script
        im checking for new open SO then create pmq for it
        pmq is our message broker
        MQ?
        message queue?
        SO-sync (SO-processor) poll the pmq for orders to be processed

        Jasper Carpizo [3:47 PM]
        the one you worked in beanstalk

        dolita [3:47 PM]
        i just managed to put it up in beanstalk
        yup
        im creating the PMQ now
        anyway dont worry abt so-sync for now
        it is nodejs
        but the process is same, create pick, pack then tms order

        Jasper Carpizo [3:51 PM]
        I'll back to you on Tuesday

        Jasper Carpizo [4:29 PM]
        hi @dolita, what do you think with this one http://php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php

        dolita [4:33 PM]
        https://www.yudiz.com/mysql-vs-mysqli-vs-pdo/
        mysqli supports procedural (easier to transition frm `mysql`) and also support async..
        we have chosen `mysqli` so there is no need to think about switching to PDO at this moment

        Jasper Carpizo [4:34 PM]
        no, I just reading with this
        no plan for swicthing to PDO :grin:
        I just browsing php function and look at this one

        dolita [4:36 PM]
        we will not be rewriting WMS at leisure pace (new things will keep coming in), so it is not going to be easy to rewrite (in fact refactoring & reusing existing service (eg the AWS API gateway) favoured)

        Jasper Carpizo [4:36 PM]
        hehehe

        dolita [4:36 PM]
        hehe ok
        i had the same qn 3 yrs ago (PDO or mysqli)
        asked senior back then
        anyway if using wms-api, the queries will be handled in typescript

        Jasper Carpizo [4:38 PM]
        ah yes, you already mention, all API's calls.

        dolita [4:38 PM]
        but to me the biggest win is `mysqli_` & `mysql_` are similar, so it is easier to write new query without sacrificing too much time
        ya
        so if you notice, in wms we ald use both mysql_ and mysqli_ (edited)

        Jasper Carpizo [4:41 PM]
        yep,, I just wondering at first, why two. but I already got your point with this.
        hehehe

        dolita [4:41 PM]
        hehe
        so if you write any new query now, do use mysqli_
        you got use PDO before?

        Jasper Carpizo [4:42 PM]
        ah not yet..

        dolita [4:42 PM]
        ic ic

        Jasper Carpizo [4:44 PM]
        yep, hehehe

        dolita [4:44 PM]
        btw gentle reminder to reply the OMSS-516 (edited)

        Jasper Carpizo [4:45 PM]
        ah yes, thank you

        dolita [4:45 PM]
        in general if ops got support request, theirs usually quite urgent coz they need to fulfil orders quickly
        basically if it is abt completing real time job, we need to put more attention to it
        while if it is abt setting up for testing etc, they can afford a bit lag
        and ops usually dont set up for testing

        Jasper Carpizo [4:47 PM]
        yeah, correct. I'm currently setup his access now.

        dolita [4:47 PM]
        ah but puah havent said follow who right?
        i think got some miscomm :grimacing:
        anyway when the new engineer come in you guys can rotate the support :blush:

        Jasper Carpizo [4:49 PM]
        ah yes.. do you have any updates ?

        dolita [4:50 PM]
        nope i dont. lets ask ty?
        i think got 1 guy come in nxt week for tms

        Jasper Carpizo [4:51 PM]
        ah yeah.. this coming Monday

        dolita [4:52 PM]
        but it does look like the next wms engineer will not come in before 16
        so you will have to train him/her :grimacing:

        Jasper Carpizo [4:53 PM]
        ah yes, I expected for that happen.

        dolita [4:53 PM]
        i have the intro slide if that helps (shared with you on your first week)

        Jasper Carpizo [4:53 PM]
        ah yes..

        dolita [4:53 PM]
        also noted down some things in confluence ald
        the rests are in the code
        do you think i shld put up some guide like what i show you so far?

        Jasper Carpizo [5:03 PM]
        ah sure, its helps me a lot, so I can back read, when I forgot something. Its that okay for you or double work?
        Sorry for this one. :grimacing:

        dolita [5:04 PM]
        nt really double work, more like nt sure if got time :grimacing:
        oh ok
        you going to review right

        Jasper Carpizo [5:05 PM]
        ah yes, I going to review tomorrow

        dolita [5:05 PM]
        why not at same time you try start the guide first?
        it can be google doc or google slide (whichever easier)
        dont worry abt the grammar/ clarity, i can add on later
        add as much screenshots as you can :grin:

        Jasper Carpizo [5:07 PM]
        ah thank you :grimacing:

        dolita [5:07 PM]
        hehe
        no prob. thanks
        btw jasper, have you set codeception test suites?
        i think i will spend some time with vishal on that nxt week cause we have some test scripts in wms that will help testing
        you also need that set up?

        Jasper Carpizo [5:13 PM]
        ah not yet .. because I install php 5.6 and need to install php7 and switch php cli to php 7
        ah okay, noted that

        dolita [5:14 PM]
        the tests suites shld be php 5.6 i think

        Jasper Carpizo [5:14 PM]
        ah yeah, they have, hehe

        dolita [5:15 PM]
        yea. anyway dont worry abt the codecept first i guess.. i will see if can settle with vishal

        Jasper Carpizo [5:16 PM]
        yeah, hehehe

        dolita [5:16 PM]
        btw are you able to onboard the new engineer ald?
        got any plan/ idea to do that?

        Jasper Carpizo [5:18 PM]
        what do you mean? WMS engineer?

        dolita [5:18 PM]
        ya the WMS engineer
        asked ty. if nt wrong claris coming on 17th

        Jasper Carpizo [5:19 PM]
        :astonished:, ah okay. I'm not ready. I'll do a plan for her.

        dolita [5:20 PM]
        remember the onboarding spreadsheet?
        use that

        Jasper Carpizo [5:20 PM]
        ah yes..

        dolita [5:20 PM]
        at least first sheet is good
        that is your nxt week food for thought :grinning:

        Jasper Carpizo [5:23 PM]
        ahhaha okay, hehe.. btw, how about the x-ray guy eyes, ahhaha (edited)

        dolita [5:23 PM]
        haha nt sure abt that
        but still can hope i guess :thinking_face:

        Jasper Carpizo [5:25 PM]
        ah yeah.. I hope we can got that guy.
        hehe

        dolita [5:25 PM]
        hehe

        Jasper Carpizo [5:34 PM]
        question, can I create a class on data_access folder? (edited)

        dolita [5:34 PM]
        yep
        can

        Jasper Carpizo [5:35 PM]
        its that okay?
        thank you :wink:

        dolita [5:35 PM]
        i think class also favoured hehe
        (judging by my recent PR, after being reviewed, i tend to end up creating class nowadays) (edited)

        Jasper Carpizo [5:36 PM]
        but we need to autload in composer.json
        ```{
            "autoload": {
                "psr-4": {"Acme\\": "src/"}
            }
        }```

        dolita [5:36 PM]
        ok
        if you add that, just got to make sure the wms & the main functions nt affected
        so need to do some general testing (eg create SO and process it)

        Jasper Carpizo [5:37 PM]
        ah yeah, its  autoload the class only..
        in the  directory.. (edited)

        dolita [5:38 PM]
        ok ok

        Jasper Carpizo [5:39 PM]
        ah thank you, but before I applied, I'll show you first. :wink:

        dolita [5:39 PM]
        yep thanks
        or you can just push PR then we shall test

        Jasper Carpizo [5:40 PM]

        hi @dolita, frederick tan asked me what's your plan for your last day. I mention you have planning to have a pizza treat this month but I'm not sure is when, hehe.. Sorry :grin:.

        dolita [12:04 PM]
        oh lol. i dont have plan actually. also no pizza treat cause things change. last day prolly come, wrap up, surrender stuffs and leave
        the pizza treat also confusing. i thought yanyan will organise last week since gisha and nizam going on leave. but she didnt. so i also dont take action. likely no pizza
        originally wanted to have it on 31st coz ty would be back by then. now even lesser ppl... like no point..

        nice

        Jasper Carpizo [3:56 PM]
        hi @dolita, nikki asked me again about the  `Enable External Tracking` I told her when enabled we used the TMS tracker right?
        btw, also asked if WMS have a connected fields that have connected to TMS, something soft of., so I mention `Enable External Tracking` right ?

        dolita [4:04 PM]
        the `Enable External Tracking` is so that we can create TMS order with tracking that is taken from the SO reference
        as for connected fields.. you should take a look at managepack and see what fields we sent to TMS via the XML API payload.. (edited)

        Jasper Carpizo [4:09 PM]
        ah okay. maybe we can discuss to Nikki because have something changes in WMS and also I'n sure about the functionality. She walk through yesterday but I have no idea some connected fields in TMS. (edited)

        dolita [4:10 PM]
        lol

        Jasper Carpizo [4:10 PM]
        hehehe

        dolita [4:10 PM]
        actually rather than "connected" fields
        more correct to say "which fields got sent to TMS"
        we dont connect to TMS directly (or try not to) (edited)

        Jasper Carpizo [4:11 PM]
        ah okay, eheh..

        dolita [4:12 PM]
        my lol is more on what the people here actually expect?

        Jasper Carpizo [4:14 PM]
        ah what do you mean? :grimacing:

        dolita [4:15 PM]
        they shld give you time to learn the stuffs

        Jasper Carpizo [4:17 PM]
        ah yes.

        dolita [4:32 PM]
        OMSS-521 actually easy
        but OMSS-520 .. you saw?

        what is it?

        dolita [4:57 PM]
        1 is check yourself. there should be a wms_picklist_item_draft row if you search for that pick ticket
        2 (better), get puah to screenshot/ provide the serial number

        Jasper Carpizo [5:04 PM]
        ah yeah, the second one.. I need to ask a screenshot with serial number but I'll try the first one, so I can check

        dolita [5:06 PM]
        yup
        i was thinking
        there shld be a record in pick draft with that uid & list_id
        and we can just delete
        but then
        i realise it is not good to act like that (assuming things and settle ourselves without checking with the other party) (edited)

        Jasper Carpizo [5:09 PM]
        ah yes, yes.. :wink:

        dolita [5:09 PM]
        they shld have encountered error, so it is better for them to show us the error exactly
        haha

        Jasper Carpizo [5:09 PM]
        yep, hehehe

        Jasper Carpizo [6:16 PM]
        hi @dolita, I have to go
        Have a nice evening :slightly_smiling_face:

        dolita [6:16 PM]

        hi @dolita, good morning :slightly_smiling_face:

        dolita [10:15 AM]
        good morning @Jasper Carpizo

        Jasper Carpizo [10:18 AM]
        I have got question from nikki `so is the SO ref number send to TMS field external tracking number?` I'm not sure with this,

        dolita [10:18 AM]
        if the setting is enabled, then yes. if not enabled, then no

        Jasper Carpizo [10:19 AM]
        ah yes, I would like to answer `yes` is enabled but I'm unsure so I need to check with you, hehehe..
        thanks @dolita :slightly_smiling_face: (edited)

        dolita [10:20 AM]
        np @Jasper Carpizo ^^

        Jasper Carpizo [10:22 AM]
        btw, I have a list of PR, that I already checked. You can review and approve if you are okay :slightly_smiling_face:

        4. WMS-302

        dolita [10:22 AM]

        Jasper Carpizo [10:24 AM]
        hi @dolita do you know this one `ok what is the exact field for SO ref?` I'm still checking what are the fields e. (edited)
        got qn from nikki.

        dolita [10:25 AM]
        ummm
        isnt it in the SO detail page? (i went thru with you last week) (edited)

        Jasper Carpizo [10:33 AM]
        its a `reference no` ?

        dolita [10:34 AM]
        try screenshot and show me?

        Jasper Carpizo [10:35 AM]
        Screenshot from 2018-12-12 10-35-24.png


        dolita [10:36 AM]
        which field?

        Jasper Carpizo [10:36 AM]
        Screenshot from 2018-12-12 10-36-17.png

        this one, the highlighted in orange

        dolita [10:36 AM]
        yep looks correct

        Jasper Carpizo [10:37 AM]
        yeah, I not remembered but I looked at the code, hehehe (edited)

        dolita [10:37 AM]
        hehe ok

        Jasper Carpizo [10:52 AM]
        I have a qn from nikki, eheh `for now mostly they store SM.... number is it?`, I mention the field name `list_SOReference` in the `wms_solist` table.

        dolita [10:53 AM]
        that qn... not our business...
        lol...
        ask her to discuss in # group channel, either WMS or IMS
        or tell her wms doesnt control what people put in `list_SOReference`

        Jasper Carpizo [10:55 AM]
        okay, thanks @dolita, I'll noted that.

        dolita [10:55 AM]
        i mean how we know what people wan to store in WMS when it is the user's SOP (standard operating procedure)? (edited)
        unless we are involved in the discussion? (edited)
        i would just say 'im unsure, it is decided by user' (smth along that line)

        Jasper Carpizo [10:58 AM]
        ah yes, :slightly_smiling_face:

        Jasper Carpizo [1:31 PM]
        hi @dolita, about the https://urbanfox.atlassian.net/browse/OMSS-520, I have already queried but I can't delete directly to mysql client.

        dolita [1:32 PM]
        what command you running?
        as in whats the query

        Jasper Carpizo [1:32 PM]
        ```DELETE FROM wms_picklist_item_draft WHERE list_itemsnid IN (
          280604
        );```


        dolita [1:32 PM]
        production right

        Jasper Carpizo [1:32 PM]
        also tried this
        ```DELETE FROM wms_picklist_item_draft WHERE list_itemsnid = 280604;```
        yes

        dolita [1:33 PM]
        what is the error you get?

        dolita [1:40 PM]
        btw im done reviewing the PR. 2 ok, 2 need more works
        we need to involve QC right

        Jasper Carpizo [1:40 PM]
        wait, I'll try to another mysql client :slightly_smiling_face:

        dolita [1:40 PM]
        can finish? lol
        ok

        Jasper Carpizo [1:40 PM]
        ah yes, I can finish :wink: (edited)

        dolita [1:41 PM]
        it is just 2 more days
        i think got that 2 more PR on duplicate
        and i haven finish briefing ^^

        Jasper Carpizo [1:49 PM]
        its already working now, about the query one :slightly_smiling_face:

        dolita [1:50 PM]
        okay
        btw be careful when you do `delete`
        we generally dont delete wms_ records too
        this is _draft, thats why

        Jasper Carpizo [1:51 PM]
        ah yes, I already backup this one.

        Jasper Carpizo [2:09 PM]
        hi @dolita, I got qn from nikki, do you know about this `can i check what is the field info that wms send to TMS dst_contact fields` ?
        `dst_contact fields`?

        dolita [2:12 PM]
        `dst_contact_fields` i think is the recipient phone (double check with TMS team) (edited)
        or... test it?

        Jasper Carpizo [3:06 PM]
        hi @dolita , I'm not sure about this `another question for existing Kao account we wi not need to enable external tracking. Am I right?` qn from nikki, I remembered Kao account is more BOM items.

        dolita [3:15 PM]
        what is the uid account of existing kao account?
        (cause kao got a lot, just want to be sure..)
        BOM items not related to SO ref -> tms tracking

        Jasper Carpizo [3:18 PM]
        ah okay :grimacing:
        this one `15938` , she saw the enable external tracking is disabled.

        dolita [3:20 PM]
        check the user_acl
        and this https://bitbucket.org/courex/courex-wms/pull-requests/84/wms-284-part-1-de-hardcode-configs-in-pack/diff

        Jasper Carpizo [3:56 PM]
        yeah, its depends on the wms ops right if they enabled or disabled the wms_config_so_reference_to_external_tracking right? Correct me if I'm wrong

        dolita [3:57 PM]
        hmm no
        right now only engineers set user acl
        and in this case, it is a wms_config... so not really an ACL (edited)
        you checked user_acl of `15938`?
        what you see?

        Jasper Carpizo [3:59 PM]

        ```{"client": true, "client_ops": true, "wms_client": true, "svc_gql_api": true, "svc_tx_info": true, "svc_tx_create": true, "svc_tx_search": true, "svc_ctrl_report": true, "svc_legacy_upload": true, "svc_backlog_report": true, "svc_generic_upload": true}```

        this one

        dolita [4:00 PM]
        ~`call courex_user_add_acl(15683, 'wms_config_so_reference_to_external_tracking');`~ (edited)
        eh wait
        ok `15938` nv enable..
        i got it mixed with `15310`
        so if nikki want `15938` TMS order to take external tracking from SO ref, then go and enable that option for 15938...

        Jasper Carpizo [4:01 PM]
        mhm, because we have external tracking enabled / disabled in our UI.
        ah yep,

        dolita [4:01 PM]
        we dont go and decide for clients...
        yep
        (now i dont know what is the qn for lol)
        coz if they want this: https://urbanfox-asia.slack.com/archives/DDVEYTZ1S/p1544601700038900 just enable it. if they dont want, then leave it disabled (it is not up to wms engineers to decide)
        dolita
        so if nikki want `15938` TMS order to take external tracking from SO ref, then go and enable that option for 15938...

        Jasper Carpizo [4:03 PM]
        She just wondering why Kao account is disabled the external tracking in our UI
        ah yes..
        hehhe

        dolita [4:03 PM]
        oh
        i think coz a lot people dont know got this feature
        (it is new)
        and it is not that obvious
        and a lot of people dont even know we can do that (cause we have influx of a lot lot new people)
        in this team alone.. only TY, gisha and hendra are older staffs
        the rest all new

        Jasper Carpizo [4:10 PM]
        So its depends on the ops, if they enable the external tracking right? (edited)

        dolita [4:11 PM]
        i think shld depend on client
        in this case 15938

        Jasper Carpizo [4:12 PM]
        ah okay, got it :slightly_smiling_face:

        Jasper Carpizo [4:38 PM]
        hi @dolita, I just checking this one https://urbanfox.atlassian.net/browse/OMSS-523, how can I remove 1 quantity of 8809485536323? (edited)

        dolita [4:39 PM]
        you just did similar fix yesterday :wink: (edited)

        Jasper Carpizo [4:41 PM]
        yesterday is an item, but its a quantity today? :thinking_face:

        dolita [4:43 PM]
        the phrase is slightly different today but they are same problem
        what you removed yesterday is quantity of an item in pick ticket by the way ^^

        Jasper Carpizo [4:47 PM]
        hehe.. got it. this is noted. :slightly_smiling_face:

        Jasper Carpizo [5:46 PM]
        hi @dolita, I have to go.  Tomorrow, we will discuss about ``Difference between wms and www.courex xml`` :slightly_smiling_face: (edited)

        dolita [5:47 PM]
        yup sure
        the rest you ok already is it?

        Jasper Carpizo [5:47 PM]
        ah yes :wink:

        dolita [5:47 PM]
        okay nice

        Jasper Carpizo [5:51 PM]
        also, needs to know what are needs to be consider to deploying in our staging / production , maybe have a demo tomorrow.

        update/ point out which points you want briefing?

        Jasper Carpizo [10:48 AM]
        i think this one first `how to manage WMS tech dev board`

        dolita [10:48 AM]
        ok
        we use sprint / scrum...

        Jasper Carpizo [10:48 AM]
        wait, can I seat beside you

        dolita [10:48 AM]
        yep
        the last one i set it to 3 weeks
        from 29nov-20 dec
        take a look at the date left
        so every end of sprint, you need to click "complete sprint"
        and start new one from backlog
        you want try with this one?
        since today is thursday

        Jasper Carpizo [10:50 AM]
        ah yes

        dolita [10:50 AM]
        (official end on thurs)

        Jasper Carpizo [10:51 AM]
        complete the sprint?

        dolita [10:51 AM]
        check if the cards all ok?
        if yes then complete it

        Jasper Carpizo [10:51 AM]
        so its okay to move to next sprint.

        dolita [10:51 AM]
        it will auto move
        ideally we create restrospective
        but not much things to note, so i dont do that

        Jasper Carpizo [10:53 AM]
        what is Retrospective time first?

        dolita [10:53 AM]
        it is noting down what happen during that sprint
        what can be improved
        and what good thing happened (edited)

        Jasper Carpizo [10:54 AM]
        okay got it :slightly_smiling_face:
        how can I set the date?

        dolita [10:55 AM]
        go to backlog

        Jasper Carpizo [10:55 AM]
        or what is next?

        dolita [10:56 AM]
        you want 2 or 3 weeks?

        Jasper Carpizo [10:56 AM]
        2 weeks
        nice, got it :wink:

        dolita [10:57 AM]
        remember to do that every 2 weeks
        so..
        if you working on a task, set the sprint & label
        for label, we refer to roadmap
        label is TY requirement
        so must add label (edited)
        can you open a task you doing now?
        can you open WMS roadmap?
        so if got new task, add the 2018-Qx-x thing to label and shift it to active sprint
        otherwise it limit the tasks visibility

        Jasper Carpizo [11:00 AM]
        okay, got it :slightly_smiling_face:

        dolita [11:00 AM]
        the procedure to move columns you know ald right
        ok done with board
        sorry i forgot 11am got exit interview :grimacing:

        Jasper Carpizo [11:01 AM]
        so we continue later?

        dolita [11:01 AM]
        we just talk first since frederick havent ping lol

        Jasper Carpizo [11:02 AM]
        maybe we can talk after benefits meeting with the HR?
        i think 4pm

        dolita [11:02 AM]
        that meeting is 3pm right
        until 4pm
        so left abt 2 hrs
        are you sure enough time?

        Jasper Carpizo [11:02 AM]
        yeah sure, we have tomorrow.

        dolita [11:06 AM]
        i will try to go through backlog and update..
        for issues we freeze, where/ how do you want to set them to?
        right now it is in sprint 999

        Jasper Carpizo [11:13 AM]
        I think, just retain this one, I'll edit if I have correct name for that, hehe..

        dolita [11:13 AM]
        we cant edit the sprint name, thats why it is in 999

        Jasper Carpizo [11:19 AM]
        mhm, maybe just retain this one.

        dolita [11:19 AM]
        ok

        dolita [11:43 AM]
        frederick said move interview to 5pm
        so you want continue?

        Jasper Carpizo [11:44 AM]
        yeah sure :slightly_smiling_face:
        how to deploy WMS

        dolita [11:45 AM]
        ok
        i got write smth abt it ytd
        https://bitbucket.org/courex/courex-wms/src/master/ (edited)
        in the readme
        we go through this together when deploying your PRs?
        but do we need to involve QC?

        Jasper Carpizo [11:47 AM]
        ah yes,

        dolita [11:47 AM]
        if involve qc, they need do fast check

        Jasper Carpizo [11:47 AM]
        thanks for this
        i think, this aready an instruction, so no worries

        dolita [11:47 AM]
        yep i added

        Jasper Carpizo [11:47 AM]
        okay lah
        JML upload (maybe)

        dolita [11:48 AM]
        okay
        can you open ytd write up?
        got pdf inside
        that is the interface. we need login to JML portal to see
        and need JML documents to try
        so normally the upload part dont have isssue
        they cannot reupload if the SO reference ald used
        and normally the error msg is quite clear in the upload side
        so after upload, jml need to submit job to be processed
        why we do that?
        it is coz JML dont realy use wms for pick and pack
        they just want to upload orders, generate their documents and have those orders go to TMS
        and that is why we have so-sync script
        which ty and me working on now
        ty will not know much abt the portal.storeviva part
        so that part you take

        Jasper Carpizo [11:54 AM]
        so after upload and processed it will sync the order to tms?

        dolita [11:54 AM]
        after upload & submit to process, so-sync does this
        `create pick` -> `create pack` ->  `send request to TMS`
        and so TMS order created

        Jasper Carpizo [11:55 AM]
        got it :wink:

        dolita [11:55 AM]
        the purpose of so-sync is for this kind scenario
        where clients dont use wms for (physical) pick pack but need the integration to TMS (edited)
        most time JML got issue is coz of the script anyway
        oh btw got 1 thing to take note
        can you open the pdf?
        you try login portal-stag.storeviva using JML credential
        http://portal-stag.storeviva.com/
        i happened to change their password in staging db
        try this `jmldirect` and `1429178791`
        it only works for this week though lol
        that is their 3 documents
        that page content is that screenshot
        that is list of "active" orders
        the orders will stay there until all 3 documents downloaded
        after the so-sync finished
        that page will show download button
        they need to click to download
        and all 3 need to be downloaded then the page will clear up
        that is the history

        Jasper Carpizo [12:03 PM]
        so, already done with this?

        dolita [12:03 PM]
        yup
        got qn?

        Jasper Carpizo [12:04 PM]
        why they used JML to upload order? because we have on WMS right?

        dolita [12:04 PM]
        WMS is UF internal apps
        so only UF staffs can use it
        (got exception with Ryca but that is all)
        every other clients use portal.storeviva.com
        JML is one of the client and they use portal.storeviva to upload orders
        the grand plan is portal.storeviva.com will be replaced with actual proper IMS (edited)
        so dont worry too much abt it
        just take note abt it

        Jasper Carpizo [12:06 PM]
        okay :slightly_smiling_face:

        dolita [12:06 PM]
        you want talk abt portal.storeviva.com now?
        JML one a bit diff (coz got custom uploader) (edited)
        but most of the rest are the same
        it is a copy of WMS
        (and legacy TMS)
        so it is an interface for clients to check their orders
        the repo is at https://bitbucket.org/courex/storeviva-portal/src
        apps is beanstalked
        "symlink"
        only WMS part linked like that

        Jasper Carpizo [12:09 PM]
        singhealth.storeviva.com

        dolita [12:09 PM]
        ok so singhealth.. is another customisation
        but it is legacy TMS
        you try login
        with jasper
        similar to portal.sv?
        but chopped until only delivery part is there
        it is legacy tms
        and most time we dont need do anything
        just for you to note

        Jasper Carpizo [12:11 PM]
        okay, got it

        dolita [12:11 PM]
        https://bitbucket.org/courex/mini-storeviva-portal/
        it is sadly nt beanstalked
        it is in EC2
        you try SSH sv-production-app-storeviva (edited)
        okay sorry rem wrong lol
        cd apps
        or rather
        ls apps
        git status
        check the git origin source
        git remote -v
        that is where the singhealth apps located

        Jasper Carpizo [12:15 PM]
        in our wms app
        where is located?

        dolita [12:15 PM]
        beanstalk
        cant ssh like that
        lol

        Jasper Carpizo [12:16 PM]
        how we can command line when we have some chnages?

        dolita [12:16 PM]
        we dont need to
        coz the scripts take care of it
        so just do smth like `make deploy/stag`
        then it will use bitbucket-pipeline to deploy to beanstalk
        (a lot integrations)

        Jasper Carpizo [12:17 PM]
        also have additonal line in composer.json ?

        dolita [12:17 PM]
        oh ya you will need to update bitbucket-pipeline.yml
        we have deploy/stag, so can test it out

        Jasper Carpizo [12:18 PM]
        because we need to run composer dumpautoload if we have autload class,
        ah okay :slightly_smiling_face:

        dolita [12:18 PM]
        yup i just remembered

        Jasper Carpizo [12:18 PM]
        Difference between wms and www.courex xml

        dolita [12:18 PM]
        so we got 2 version of legacy tms XML API
        the one in www.courex is what we distribute to clients
        the one in wms is strictly for UF internal usage
        (eg our WMS)
        and we got legacy documentation on the xml api
        https://storeviva.github.io/
        oh lunch time ald?
        we dont want people to use xml api so just keep this doc to yourself
        and fellow engineers

        Jasper Carpizo [12:21 PM]
        okay.. so will continue after lunch
        lunch lah

        dolita [1:30 PM]
        we didnt touch on this just now, but to create new sprint, click this `Create sprint` button (at right side there). (i ald created up to 27)

        dolita [1:40 PM]
        :thumbsup:
        shall we push a couple of PRs?
        need to get qc to help check

        Jasper Carpizo [1:44 PM]
        ah sure, so I can check, how  we can deploy :slightly_smiling_face: (edited)

        dolita [1:45 PM]
        yup we can deploy tgt and ideally clear all existing PRs before i go (edited)

        Jasper Carpizo [1:45 PM]
        ah yes :slightly_smiling_face:

        Jasper Carpizo [1:55 PM]
        hi @dolita, I just mapping the table Outbound table for `Outbound Order - Cancel`  like we did in `Outbound Order - Create` (edited)

        dolita [1:56 PM]
        ok
        mapping table, then?

        Jasper Carpizo [1:56 PM]
        I think is a new table for `cancel` (edited)
        ```{
          order_id: aRequiredString,
          cancel_reason: {                  // (*)
            code: aRequiredString,
            description: aOptionalString
          }
        }```

        also with `return` (edited)
        ```{
          order_id: aRequiredString,
          return_reason: {                   // (*)
            code: aRequiredString,
            description: aOptionalString,
          }
        }```

        dolita [1:57 PM]
        there is (*) what is stated?

        Jasper Carpizo [1:58 PM]
        (*) needs new custom fields table

        dolita [1:58 PM]
        (sorry cause my memory also hazy, but sounds like you are right. except new table is not called `cancel`)
        i think there is some custom table..

        Jasper Carpizo [2:02 PM]
        ```What about the cancel and return logic in the WMS UI ?

        what does it do ?```
        from akash

        dolita [2:09 PM]
        cancel, return, maybe need to discuss with ty about it? as in you, akash & ty

        dolita [3:28 PM]
        Jasper, can I push PR# 92, 93, 72, 73, to QC? I want to push #94 too but need update the yml

        Jasper Carpizo [3:30 PM]
        yeah sure @dolita :wink:
        yes, we need to update yml

        dolita [3:31 PM]
        are you able to update quickly or leave it for later?

        Jasper Carpizo [3:35 PM]
        opps, how can I update the yml? yml in the root folder?

        dolita [3:38 PM]
        i think you need update 3 files
        `docker/dev/Dockerfile`, `docker/prod/Dockerfile`, `docker/stag/Dockerfile`

        Jasper Carpizo [4:23 PM]
        ah yes @dolita.
        hi @dolita do you have any idea for this one https://urbanfox.atlassian.net/browse/OMSS-524, sorry :grimacing:

        dolita [4:24 PM]
        lol. ok ok
        so you see she tried to send the request

        Jasper Carpizo [4:24 PM]
        ah yes

        dolita [4:25 PM]
        in managepack, there is section that send payload via xml api right

        Jasper Carpizo [4:25 PM]
        yep

        dolita [4:25 PM]
        on 2nd screen you see got feedback

        Jasper Carpizo [4:25 PM]
        error message (edited)

        dolita [4:25 PM]
        meaning the sending part is ok
        and the api server also receive it
        validate it
        and reject
        the hairy prob is that... the api server nv tell us why
        and by "api server", i mean this: https://bitbucket.org/courex/courex-wms/src/master/wms/xml/
        (notice endpoint of curl in managepack.php is to this "page") (edited)

        Jasper Carpizo [4:29 PM]
        `curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, get_server_url()."/wms/xml/"); // https`
        this one right?

        dolita [4:29 PM]
        so it is smth need to be fixed (as in give us proper error feedback..)
        yup

        Jasper Carpizo [4:31 PM]
        ah yes.. for now we don't have to catch error.

        dolita [4:31 PM]
        yup

        Jasper Carpizo [4:31 PM]
        so its api issue?

        dolita [4:31 PM]
        nope

        Jasper Carpizo [4:33 PM]
        in the order tracking no is empty? (edited)

        dolita [4:34 PM]
        yes it is empty. but got a reason why it is empty
        and it is nt api fault

        Jasper Carpizo [4:34 PM]
        okay, ehhe

        dolita [4:35 PM]
        :slightly_smiling_face:

        `CustomerSORef` that is the external tracking number

        Jasper Carpizo [4:39 PM]
        ah okay..

        dolita [4:39 PM]
        we dont generate TMS internal tracking

        Jasper Carpizo [4:42 PM]
        this one
        ```if ($so_reference_is_external_tracking === true && isset($_POST['valueCustomerSORef'])) {

        dolita [4:42 PM]
        well
        there is no issue with that part
        it is issue with data validation
        and the validation is at "api server"
        (you looking at wrong place)

        do these 3 make sense?

        Jasper Carpizo [4:55 PM]
        ah yes :slightly_smiling_face:
        so, the issue are the data validation.  Can I solve issue without editing the api data validation? (edited)
        there's a way to fix it?

        dolita [5:09 PM]
        the issue is the data failed validation
        so why do we edit the api?
        it is the data that got issue

        Jasper Carpizo [5:09 PM]
        no edit, hehe

        dolita [5:10 PM]
        need to edit the data

        Jasper Carpizo [5:20 PM]
        so they to edit the data in SO page right?

        dolita [5:21 PM]
        yup but which data fail validation?
        found out ald?

        Jasper Carpizo [5:22 PM]
        I'm not sure `Customer PO No.` field.

        dolita [5:22 PM]
        nope nt that one

        Jasper Carpizo [5:25 PM]
        the `Customer Reference Info` but on the screenshot given have a value

        dolita [5:26 PM]
        nope nt that

        dolita [5:33 PM]

        Jasper Carpizo [5:34 PM]
        ahahhahaha.. yes the email is N/A

        dolita [5:34 PM]
        you saw the `checkEmail` function?

        Jasper Carpizo [5:35 PM]
        ah yes
        so they to edit the email in the SO page
        for now, they input as a `NA`

        dolita [5:37 PM]
        yup
        it is `NA` so just leave it blank
        i mean edit and remove the NA, let it blank
        the weird thing is if phone is NA we accept that (lol)
        i think that email validation part need to be updated to accept `NA` (edited)
        i can update if you want

        Jasper Carpizo [5:44 PM]
        ah sure, if you have time. Sorry :grimacing:

        dolita [5:45 PM]
        i mean i will update the code to accept NA
        hehe

        Jasper Carpizo [5:45 PM]
        yeah, hehe

        dolita [5:45 PM]
        but you can tell de silva to remove the NA for now
        in her request

        Jasper Carpizo [5:45 PM]

        dolita [10:31 AM]
        so ah
        on OMSS-525
        how do you delete it?
        i got 2 comments here
        can say? lol

        Jasper Carpizo [10:32 AM]
        just update the list active to 0
        that's the correct way?

        dolita [10:32 AM]
        you mean item_active?

        Jasper Carpizo [10:33 AM]
        yes

        dolita [10:33 AM]
        it is
        but
        1. user has ability to do that themselves (it is kind of hairy for them though)
        2. dont act on all their requests. sometime the requests are not valid
        case where it can be invalid, 1) user can do it themselves, 2) it is "illegal" procedure
        anyway just a comment, since you done ald, nvm ald
        there is a counter script for BOM btw

        Jasper Carpizo [10:35 AM]
        no its important to me..  can you show me that user have ability to delete the item.
        so next time have a request again, I'm referring this
        wait i'll check

        dolita [10:37 AM]
        user can deactivate if item stock is 0

        dolita [10:37 AM]
        the thing about BOM is they cannot control the stock directly. BOM stock is derived from components

        dolita [10:42 AM]
        btw keep this link too: https://urbanfox.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OMS/pages/248053799/Current+Apps+Services+-+as+at+2018+Dec+15
        jumping to next topic: do you have plan for claris ald? shall i clone out the onboarding spreadsheet?

        Jasper Carpizo [10:44 AM]

        Jasper Carpizo [11:06 AM]
        ah yes, thank you so much @dolita, I do my best to pass the knowledge in WMS to her as you do to me.

        Jasper Carpizo [12:20 PM]
        hi @dolita, what is RMA means? :grimacing:
        return merchandise auth?

        dolita [12:21 PM]
        yep
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_merchandise_authorization
        Wikipedia
        Return merchandise authorization
        A return merchandise authorization (RMA), return authorization (RA) or return goods authorization (RGA) is a part of the process of returning a product to receive a refund, replacement, or repair during the product's warranty period. The purchaser of the product must contact the manufacturer (or distributor or retailer) to obtain authorization to return the product. The resulting RMA or RGA number must be displayed on or included in the returned product's packaging;Return to vendor (RTV) refers to the process where goods are returned to the original vendor as opposed to the distributor.

        Jasper Carpizo [12:21 PM]
        ah, yes hehe.. thank you :slightly_smiling_face:

        Jasper Carpizo [12:45 PM]
        hi @dolita, just message me, if you are available, ehehe..

        dolita [12:45 PM]
        hehe ok gimme abt 10 mins (edited)

        Jasper Carpizo [12:46 PM]
        ah yes take your time :slightly_smiling_face: (edited)

        dolita [12:51 PM]
        ok. lets start?

        Jasper Carpizo [12:55 PM]
        we can start with this one , hehe
        GRN w PO/ GRN without PO/ GRN without PO (scanning)

        dolita [12:55 PM]
        ok
        so for inbound we can do either with PO or without PO
        if with PO, only 1 way to receive
        use times
        that 1 page got 2 ways to access
        actually proper way is to scan

        Jasper Carpizo [12:59 PM]
        if we have no scan, should we do the item
        search to the iventory

        dolita [1:00 PM]
        if im nt wrong this page doesnt restrict like pick ticket
        so everyone can just enter qty
        optional
        coz it is GRN of a PO, cannot receive more than what is in PO
        must be exact
        then a PO can have multiple GRN
        eg if got 2 items, then item A received first
        ppl can come back and receive item B
        but in total, the whole GRN summed up cannot exceed PO
        (i think WMS might not be bug free here)
        the PO must be same as GRN (total)
        it is one of the task you doing now
        that one select item first
        then create GRN right away
        no PO one

        Jasper Carpizo [1:05 PM]
        i'm okay with PO received
        how about the without PO
        either of 3 tabls without PO

        dolita [1:05 PM]
        practically almost all other GRN is no PO
        the one at bottom specialy for serial items
        zaid used it
        nt sure if you remember?
        he was scanning a lot times
        1 box 2 times

        Jasper Carpizo [1:06 PM]
        on the warehouse

        dolita [1:06 PM]
        yep warehouse

        Jasper Carpizo [1:07 PM]
        the first we saw

        dolita [1:07 PM]
        first scan barcode of item
        then scan barcode of serial
        that is how system register the relationship of item-serial

        Jasper Carpizo [1:08 PM]
        what is this for Goods Receive w/o PO (Scan)

        dolita [1:08 PM]
        that one as long as you got item with barcode can receive right away
        let me demo?
        this page got modified
        can receive without name address
        they want fast receiving you see
        as long as got DO# can refer back
        you try
        either select frm drop down
        or scan it

        Jasper Carpizo [1:12 PM]
        got it :slightly_smiling_face:
        GRN for serialised items/ Picking for serialised item

        dolita [1:13 PM]
        times dont have serial item
        use sennheiser
        need to select item with "Item UI" yes
        UI here stands for unique identifier
        sorry nt select
        click go in
        need get barcode
        serial number is "free"
        can you do it again?
        just now abcde is input text
        but now it is just text
        forget why
        nvm it is ok
        ltr i go thru 1 bug with u + 1 special customer (ryca) (edited)

        Jasper Carpizo [1:18 PM]
        ah yes

        dolita [1:18 PM]
        after yours finish i mean

        Jasper Carpizo [1:19 PM]
        so we done with this one?
        Adjustment/ Main adjustment

        dolita [1:19 PM]
        ok
        2 ways to adjust
        adjustment is to add/deduct qty or transfer item to another location
        for eg when they do stock take and realise got disrepancy
        it is kind of "grey" area actually
        but let us go and see the feature

        Jasper Carpizo [1:21 PM]
        so we can add a stock on another location that have an dsirepancy?
        transfer

        dolita [1:21 PM]
        transfer is not grey as in we can move stocks to another location
        it is the add or deduct that is grey
        coz inbound - outbound = inventory
        if always do correctly shld be correct
        no need adjust qty
        but somehow this is needed
        maybe got times items come in but not for inbounding
        ?
        i guess
        it is nt used often
        but it is still 1 of the impt feature
        need pagination there
        the option clear?
        stock adjust is if want to add or deduct
        this page clear?
        that page cannot adjust UI (serialised) item (edited)
        got a script that auto fetch qty of the exiting location
        (just want show u that)

        Jasper Carpizo [1:28 PM]
        okay :slightly_smiling_face:
        add a quantiyy?

        dolita [1:29 PM]
        got 2 sku
        nv add the top one?
        any loc
        that shld be clear? you can try transfer?

        Jasper Carpizo [1:30 PM]
        yep, I'll try agaib
        we cannot add

        dolita [1:32 PM]
        the inventory for serial number is like 1 serial 1 line. the traditional adjustment doesnt work with it
        that is why i exclude them frm the item list
        it will mess up data
        so serial items dont have adjustment
        if wh ask for it next time, can do
        if not, i guess they can live without it for now (edited)
        main adjustment
        this page very "powerful"
        u see it?
        typo
        can add hundreds of items with just a typo
        so very powerful page lol

        Jasper Carpizo [1:36 PM]
        ahahha
        yes

        dolita [1:36 PM]
        dangerous

        Jasper Carpizo [1:36 PM]
        it is

        dolita [1:36 PM]
        but got adjustment note
        in wms we try to record everything

        Jasper Carpizo [1:38 PM]
        got it :slightly_smiling_face:
        btw, can we discuss about return and cancel, so I can discuss to akash and ty later

        dolita [1:40 PM]
        we only gt return btw
        dont have cancel
        so that will be new thing
        can only return frm completed SO
        is that test db?
        i think someone doing testing
        all the SO qty deactivated
        (maybe u ask akash ltr)
        change to stag db (edited)
        up to u?
        tick what u want to return (edited)
        sometime returned is damaged
        so need select accordingly
        but i think normally ppl dont do RMA-> gRN right away
        coz usually RMA created by cust
        GRN done by ops
        i show u?

        Jasper Carpizo [1:47 PM]
        ah yes

        dolita [1:48 PM]
        rma created
        then ops go there to do receiving
        seems like complicated is it

        Jasper Carpizo [1:49 PM]
        ah first, hehehe

        dolita [1:49 PM]
        yep. after u used to it everything "make sense"

        Jasper Carpizo [1:49 PM]
        ah yes

        dolita [1:50 PM]
        got a way to create return nt from SO
        but it is not often used
        i think some users also dont know got such thing
        u want to see?

        Jasper Carpizo [1:51 PM]
        the shortcut one

        dolita [1:51 PM]
        but from thr no record which SO
        so we always encourage return via SO

        Jasper Carpizo [1:51 PM]
        okay :slightly_smiling_face:

        dolita [1:52 PM]
        ok
        that one
        when u do GRN scanning ones
        got temporary & immediate right
        the temporary is if they want to receive into an area first
        but not open for usage
        meaning whatever received cannot be used yet
        so the inventory record created
        qty is in temp_qty
        try 4448
        nowadays nt used much though
        cause the feature not completed
        they are the one who use temporary a lot

        Jasper Carpizo [1:54 PM]
        got it :slightly_smiling_face:

        dolita [1:55 PM]
        btw for serial items right, serial numbers can be from factory (like sennheiser)
        or it can be from us (if the products usually dont have serial but cust want it)
        nowadays nobody use that anymore though

        Jasper Carpizo [1:56 PM]
        btw, how about the support issue that I did

        dolita [1:56 PM]
        u try locate same item
        in stag shld still be there
        the same item mentioned in support
        u ald deactivated
        but in stag shld be still active
        try open it
        that is not BOM?
        oh look like they created this week after stag copied
        u see the other items
        qty 0
        can deactivate
        u try create new BOM
        but once they add component
        the component qty will be counted into BOM
        (there is a cron script that do the calculation)
        so if BOM gt qty cant deactivate
        u try kao
        and try remove component

        Jasper Carpizo [2:03 PM]
        so i deleted the component right?

        dolita [2:03 PM]
        nope
        i was trying to show it is difficult

        Jasper Carpizo [2:03 PM]
        ah okay

        dolita [2:03 PM]
        we need to remove components qty first
        then wait for cron to update BOM qty to 0
        then can deactivate
        if we simply remove component, the cron cannot update the BOM qty
        cause component data lost liao
        (thats a bug btw)
        so it doesnt make sense if we must 0 off components then can deactivate BOM

        Jasper Carpizo [2:05 PM]
        that makes sense for now.

        dolita [2:05 PM]
        i think u help them delete is nt bad

        Jasper Carpizo [2:06 PM]
        i mean, we need to wait the sync one to zero components quantity

        dolita [2:06 PM]
        sync will zero BOM qty

        Jasper Carpizo [2:06 PM]
        but in the case that I did, I think its an urgent one
        right?

        dolita [2:06 PM]
        nt very sure
        got once i got request to remove bom
        https://urbanfox.atlassian.net/browse/OMSS-493
        u can experiment

        Jasper Carpizo [2:12 PM]
        I just noted down, ehhe
        ah sure

        dolita [2:14 PM]
        hehe
        you got keep this link? https://urbanfox.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OMS/pages/248053799/Current+Apps+Services+-+as+at+2018+Dec+15
        got mention bom script inside

        Jasper Carpizo [2:16 PM]
        ah yes, thank you @dolita :slightly_smiling_face:

        dolita [2:18 PM]
        i think hard to try in test/ stag cause the script doesnt run in test db
        but u can download and execute it locally
        lol

        Jasper Carpizo [2:19 PM]
        hahaha

        dolita [2:19 PM]
        need learn how to "hack" stuffs around

        Jasper Carpizo [2:19 PM]
        yes yes ahahha
        okay lah., hahaha..

        dolita [2:19 PM]
        are we good ald?
        oh the monthly thing (edited)

        Jasper Carpizo [2:20 PM]
        yes, :wink:
        yes, 1 month

        dolita [2:20 PM]
        no i mean the monthly update thing hehe
        https://urbanfox.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/WMS/pages/249102446/Monthly+update+of+Fuel+Surcharge
        need do this every 1st of month
        sorry i fail to automate this part
        but we are just holding until new international system up

        Jasper Carpizo [2:21 PM]
        what is this for?

        dolita [2:21 PM]
        it is to update fuel surcharge in database (edited)
        in international delivery, the fuel charge change every mth
        so just need to go to this page, get the rate, then run the  update
        got 2, DHL & DHL-D

        Jasper Carpizo [2:22 PM]
        so per month, eg ( Jan 1)

        dolita [2:23 PM]
        next one
        WMS-201
        i didnt manage to trace down the bug
        i think i will jus note down in the ticket ok

        Jasper Carpizo [2:25 PM]
        ah yes

        dolita [2:25 PM]
        then next one
        WMS-326
        i just did this
        but the point is we have a user (jumaidi) who use WMS but he is not UF staff
        he is ryca staff
        and only 1 such scenario
        so when jumaidi login, he only see ryca's account
        mmm ok i forgot to update staging
        but when he click controller, he see access denied
        just note down got such arrangement

        Jasper Carpizo [4:03 PM]
        its correct, we have an array items
        ?

        dolita [4:03 PM]
        sounds correct but nt sure abt the table

        Jasper Carpizo [4:04 PM]
        ah yes

        dolita [4:04 PM]
        shld be `wms_rma_list` and list item i think (edited)

        Jasper Carpizo [4:06 PM]
        ah yes, youre right :slightly_smiling_face:

        dolita [4:06 PM]
        lol ok

        Jasper Carpizo [4:07 PM]
        because I'm confuse,  first when you create an return, 1st query, make a rms record right
        then 2nd query, items to be selected `wms_solist_item_rma`
        right? (edited)

        dolita [4:08 PM]
        ah yes
        the 2nd query is to get the rma items to be inserted into grn
        so for api, shld be `wms_rmalist` and `wms_rmalist_item`

        Jasper Carpizo [4:09 PM]
        yep
        the `wms_rmalist_item` is the items to be selected right
        so we need the items in the request body? (edited)

        dolita [4:12 PM]
        we sure need items

        dolita [4:22 PM]
        need give both tables one

        Jasper Carpizo [4:23 PM]
        `cos not all items in SO going to be returned ?` definitely yes ?

        dolita [4:23 PM]
        yea

        hi @Akash @ty, upon checking the docs, on the return SO, we need to select the items to be return, that be inserted to `wms_rmalist` , so we have an array items with the following fields (`item_sku`, `item_name`, `quantity`  and `condition` in the request body.  @dolita, correct me if I'm wrong.
