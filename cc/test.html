<p><strong>Premium Members</strong> have more options of what they can hide, such as:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Join Date</li>
	<li>Recent Login Location</li>
	<li>Online Status / Last Active Date</li>
	<li>When You View Someone</li>
	<li>When You Favorite Someone</li>

<p>If you hide a member, you won&rsquo;t see them in search, member dashboard, interests, or email notifications. You can hide a member in search as well as your favorites or viewed me list by hovering over their profile and select &ldquo;Hide Profile&rdquo;. You can also go directly to their profile and select &ldquo;Hide&rdquo; from the top right-hand corner of the page.You can go to your settings to view a full list of hidden members.</p>

<p>*Blocking*</p>

<p>Blocking members does the same thing that hiding does, but it will also prevent them from sending you messages as well as viewing your profile. You can block a member by going directly to their profile and selecting &ldquo;Block&rdquo; from the top right-hand corner of the page. Please note that blocking is PERMANENT.</p>"
