<span class="go">:astonished:, I thought is until end of December.  Yes, I&#39;ll get to you tomorrow. :slightly_smiling_face: (edited)</span>

<span class="go">dolita [11:22 AM]</span>
<span class="go">yea management gave me another choice ytd, either 24 jan next year or 16 dec (my original plan). i cant stay so long, so 16 dec is my choice</span>
<span class="go">can you set aside some time today, going to show you omss (got 1 ticket pending)</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [11:24 AM]</span>
<span class="go">mhm, yeah sure after lunch today.</span>

<span class="go">dolita [11:24 AM]</span>
<span class="go">as per original plan of mine, since 1 dec, you will take over manning OMSS (WMS support board) ^^</span>
<span class="go">okay</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [11:35 AM]</span>
<span class="go">ah yes @dolita :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [1:52 PM]</span>
<span class="go">hi @dolita, let me know, if you are available :wink:</span>

<span class="go">dolita [1:54 PM]</span>
<span class="go">yep</span>
<span class="go">let&#39;s start then?</span>
<span class="go">i just added you to #wms_support channel. so when there is movement in OMSS, will get notification</span>
<span class="go">right now got 1 pending task (as you see ald)</span>
<span class="go">the background is like this</span>
<span class="go">when wh finished pick and pack, they found out there are shortage</span>
<span class="go">so we have to help them remove that from pick list</span>
<span class="go">it is kind of unofficial SOP</span>
<span class="go">and in new project like wing tai, we will not entertain that request</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [1:57 PM]</span>
<span class="go">okay  got it</span>

<span class="go">dolita [1:58 PM]</span>
<span class="go">so the key is if got shortage &amp; need to remove from pick list =&gt; we do</span>
<span class="go">if they want to add item into picklist =&gt; reject, ask them create new SO or so</span>
<span class="go">you understand the ticket?</span>
<span class="go">what you think shld be done?</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [2:00 PM]</span>
<span class="go">yep, remove the items in the pick ticket PI2018-004915 under courex id 17952?</span>

<span class="go">dolita [2:00 PM]</span>
<span class="go">i actually got a script to do that easily</span>
<span class="go">coz it is not simply editing wms_picklist_item</span>
<span class="go">firstly can you go to that pick ticket in wms ?</span>
<span class="go">how you know which one nt picked?</span>
<span class="go">nice</span>
<span class="go">last time i removed pickpack_admin acl from your account (edited)</span>
<span class="go">can you add it back?</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [2:04 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ah yes</span>

<span class="go">dolita [2:08 PM]</span>
<span class="go">refresh the pick ticket again</span>
<span class="go">dont have to update user ... coz yours not newly set</span>
<span class="go">anyway back to pick ticket</span>
<span class="go">thats refreshed?</span>
<span class="go">can check your ACL?</span>
<span class="go">is dev inside?</span>
<span class="go">cross check mine, UID 2202</span>
<span class="go">cross check with my ACL</span>
<span class="go">set dev to yours</span>
<span class="go">yep set your ACL, add dev ACL</span>

<span class="go">dolita [2:18 PM]</span>
<span class="go">backup wms_solist_item also</span>
<span class="go">then back to pick list page, at each line that hasnt been picked fully, click &#39;special remove&#39; link</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [2:21 PM]</span>
<span class="go">okay :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

<span class="go">dolita [2:21 PM]</span>
<span class="go">lol, can you open that file?</span>
<span class="go">in code</span>
<span class="go">check what permission is required</span>
<span class="go">got 2 solution for this</span>
<span class="go">1st one add your uid in whitelist</span>
<span class="go">2nd one remove that lines (and check acl instead)</span>
<span class="go">just know that that page is for dev only</span>
<span class="go">it is a series of queries</span>
<span class="go">i added so i can just click and get the job done lol</span>
<span class="go">which 1 you think better?</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [2:26 PM]</span>
<span class="go">may I can use your account for temporary</span>

<span class="go">dolita [2:26 PM]</span>
<span class="go">maybe you want maintain 2 accounts</span>
<span class="go">1st one jasper (set it as non pickpack_admin)</span>
<span class="go">then 2nd one is for when you need do these things? (edited)</span>
<span class="go">you can rename user.Username when im gone</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [2:27 PM]</span>
<span class="go">No, hehe</span>

<span class="go">dolita [2:27 PM]</span>
<span class="go">it is ok, better rename</span>
<span class="go">if not kind of funny to see my names &quot;everywhere&quot;</span>
<span class="go">look around top there</span>
<span class="go">you may want to add some kind of differentiator when accessing local-wms vs wms.courex next time (edited)</span>
<span class="go">you see &#39;create packing list&#39;</span>
<span class="go">it means all items record picked successfully</span>
<span class="go">if still got unpicked, it will nt show</span>
<span class="go">there is only 1 issue with that special remove. that is if `wms_solist_item.list_itemqty` &amp; `wms_solist_item.list_itemqtyout` not matching, it will go to error</span>
<span class="go">can you go to specialremove.php and search for the `list_itemqty`?</span>
<span class="go">if so_qty != so_qtyout</span>
<span class="go">it is some bug..</span>
<span class="go">so when you run special remove link, if you see that echo `!!!!...`</span>
<span class="go">just update so_qtyout to be same as so_qty</span>
<span class="go">(of course after you do some due diligence checks)</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [2:37 PM]</span>
<span class="go">I noted, so I can review with this later</span>

<span class="go">dolita [2:37 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ok we are done with OMSS, see you tmr?</span>

<span class="go">if unfortunately not in the list, you can search past OMSS/WMS or try to look in the code (edited)</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [2:58 PM]</span>
<span class="go">great! have some references. yeah, no worries. I&#39;ll search in the code if ever.</span>

<span class="go">dolita [2:58 PM]</span>
<span class="go">:+1::woman-bowing:</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [2:58 PM]</span>
<span class="go">hehe.. Thanks a lot :wink: (edited)</span>

<span class="go">dolita [2:59 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ping me if you want me to review the PRs</span>

<span class="go">dolita [3:08 PM]</span>
<span class="go">btw jasper, puah&#39;s jira account got issue such that she is unable to see comments in all tickets (including the one she created)</span>
<span class="go">(thats why ytd i ask her find me)</span>
<span class="go">i just told her abt OMSS-509 via hangout. she said it is good, we can close it (edited)</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [3:11 PM]</span>
<span class="go">hehe.. okay. So I can click the `Mark as Done` to close the ticket? (edited)</span>

<span class="go">dolita [3:12 PM]</span>
<span class="go">yup</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [3:13 PM]</span>
<span class="go">Done :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

<span class="go">dolita [3:14 PM]</span>
<span class="go">nice</span>

<span class="go">dolita [4:29 PM]</span>
<span class="go">look like we can schedule some PR for next wed deployments</span>
<span class="go">(am i right?)</span>
<span class="go">it gonna be my last deployment. i shld be showing you as well</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [4:31 PM]</span>
<span class="go">mhm, btw, any feedback about this one https://bitbucket.org/courex/courex-wms/pull-requests/94</span>

<span class="go">dolita [4:32 PM]</span>
<span class="go">i would like to merge the script with the one autocompleting wms account</span>
<span class="go">but then it is nt impt now. i wanted to _merge_ it myself but i think no more time. so just leave it alone. we can do other more critical tasks first (edited)</span>
<span class="go">so i guess it is good to go</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [4:34 PM]</span>
<span class="go">understood :slightly_smiling_face:,  we can go to critical one.</span>

<span class="go">dolita [4:34 PM]</span>
<span class="go">yep</span>
<span class="go">so i think other than the dupe in pick list one, most of it are good. by tmr or day after tmr we will put in #wms list of PR to be scheduled for next wed deployment (edited)</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [4:39 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ah yes.. :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

<span class="go">hi @dolita, good morning.</span>
<span class="go">I have a question, on what page that I can find this issue `User can attempt to create duplicated receival from PO` ? (edited)</span>

<span class="go">dolita [10:34 AM]</span>
<span class="go">morning Jasper</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [10:34 AM]</span>
<span class="go">:wink:</span>

<span class="go">dolita [10:35 AM]</span>
<span class="go">the PRs all settled? including duplicate pick ticket?</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [10:35 AM]</span>
<span class="go">ah not yet :grimacing:</span>

<span class="go">dolita [10:35 AM]</span>
<span class="go">oh ok just asking</span>
<span class="go">it is good time to show you inbound</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [10:37 AM]</span>
<span class="go">ah yes.. upon checking the task that I assigned to me. I just look the inbound but after have idea for it. I just continue working some PR&#39;s :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

<span class="go">dolita [10:37 AM]</span>
<span class="go">yep no worries</span>
<span class="go">lets talk abt inbound then?</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [10:37 AM]</span>
<span class="go">ah yes :wink:</span>

<span class="go">dolita [10:37 AM]</span>
<span class="go">so inbound is what is under `Purchasing` tab</span>
<span class="go">the main activity in inbound is `to receive`, so the main feature is `GR` (goods receiving)</span>
<span class="go">and those receiving are listed under `GRN` (goods receiving note)</span>
<span class="go">with GRN, we have 3 main ways.. 1) GRN with PO, 2) GRN w/o PO (list the items then select and do GRN), 3) GRN w/o PO scan (scan barcode directly)</span>
<span class="go">shld i continue or it is easier for you to find out yourself?</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [10:41 AM]</span>
<span class="go">ah yes, just continue, so I  have an idea</span>

<span class="go">dolita [10:42 AM]</span>
<span class="go">i feel like before i talk abt inbound, i need to talk about inventory first</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [10:43 AM]</span>
<span class="go">ah okay, hehe.., sure we can discuss first the inventory</span>

<span class="go">dolita [10:43 AM]</span>
<span class="go">ok</span>
<span class="go">what is the diff itemmaster vs inventory?</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [10:45 AM]</span>
<span class="go">item master =  all the product list , inventory =  numbers of items / product are available. (edited)</span>

<span class="go">dolita [10:45 AM]</span>
<span class="go">ok</span>
<span class="go">so inventory is the stock level ie how many units of that SKU _stored_ in warehouse</span>
<span class="go">but there are some specifications in inventory</span>
<span class="go">1) location, 2) expiry date, 3) serialised vs non-serialised items, 4) creation date, 5) last picked date</span>
<span class="go">i think 1,2,4,5 are self-described (i.e. you see the words, you know what it is ald) (edited)</span>
<span class="go">am i right?</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [10:48 AM]</span>
<span class="go">ah yes</span>

<span class="go">dolita [10:49 AM]</span>
<span class="go">you want try explain to me?</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [10:51 AM]</span>
<span class="go">on our warehouse, I saw the the label of SKU, so its the `location` right ? (edited)</span>

<span class="go">dolita [10:51 AM]</span>
<span class="go">label of SKU?</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [10:53 AM]</span>
<span class="go">correct me I&#39;m wrong, because saw in the warehouse, have some little label</span>

<span class="go">dolita [10:54 AM]</span>
<span class="go">label at where? the boxes?</span>
<span class="go">or racks? what is the label like?</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [10:54 AM]</span>
<span class="go">on the racks</span>

<span class="go">dolita [10:54 AM]</span>
<span class="go">the one i pointed?</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [10:54 AM]</span>
<span class="go">yes</span>

<span class="go">dolita [10:55 AM]</span>
<span class="go">when we going inside?</span>
<span class="go">yep that is _location_</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [10:55 AM]</span>
<span class="go">yes, I remembered you said the SKU</span>
<span class="go">hehehe</span>

<span class="go">dolita [10:55 AM]</span>
<span class="go">i can create location like `jasper` and it also is a _location_</span>
<span class="go">hmmm</span>
<span class="go">SKU is.. the itemmaster identification</span>
<span class="go">pretty sure i wont refer to rack label as SKU</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [10:56 AM]</span>
<span class="go">ah okay, maybe I wrong, hehe.. but its a location of an items (edited)</span>

<span class="go">dolita [10:56 AM]</span>
<span class="go">yep</span>
<span class="go">location of a SKU also correct</span>
<span class="go">but location != SKU</span>
<span class="go">you want to continue 2, 4, 5?</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [10:57 AM]</span>
<span class="go">ah yes, noted.</span>
<span class="go">expiry date,  = item expiration date</span>
<span class="go">serialised =  is the one we can scan, correct me if I am wrong ah</span>

<span class="go">dolita [10:59 AM]</span>
<span class="go">well</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [10:59 AM]</span>
<span class="go">non-serialised =  we can pack directly</span>

<span class="go">dolita [10:59 AM]</span>
<span class="go">i think i only say 1,2,4,5 ^^</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [11:00 AM]</span>
<span class="go">ops, hehehe</span>
<span class="go">yep, the creation date of the items,  and datetime the last picked on an item</span>

<span class="go">dolita [11:02 AM]</span>
<span class="go">it is creation date of inventory</span>
<span class="go">in this context, item is nt inventory</span>
<span class="go">lets say on monday yanyan create SKU called `SKU-12345`. the creation date of this item = 3 dec 2018</span>
<span class="go">then today the item come, so i do receival of `1 PIECE` into location `L2M`, what is the creation date of this item? it is still 3 dec 2018 (edited)</span>
<span class="go">but what is the creation date of this _inventory_? it is today, 5 dec</span>
<span class="go">when you are asked what is the inventory of `SKU-12345` now? the ans is there is `1 piece in L2M, creation date 5 dec 2018`</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [11:05 AM]</span>
<span class="go">what is L2M?</span>

<span class="go">dolita [11:05 AM]</span>
<span class="go">location</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [11:06 AM]</span>
<span class="go">its still  3 dec 2018</span>

<span class="go">dolita [11:07 AM]</span>
<span class="go">?</span>
<span class="go">you mean im wrong and the creation date of inventory is 3 dec 2018?</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [11:08 AM]</span>
<span class="go">Nope, the creation date is dec 5, 2018</span>
<span class="go">hehe</span>

<span class="go">dolita [11:08 AM]</span>
<span class="go">ok. you mean `creation date of item` is still 3 dec 2018?</span>
<span class="go">anyway the database helps to visualise this</span>
<span class="go">so no worries ^^</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [11:09 AM]</span>
<span class="go">ah, okay, hehe..   Its dec 5,</span>
<span class="go">because its a first creation of an inventory</span>

<span class="go">dolita [11:10 AM]</span>
<span class="go">yep</span>
<span class="go">prolly more correct to say &quot;creation date of that inventory record&quot;</span>
<span class="go">shall we continue, #3, serialised vs non-serialised items?</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [11:11 AM]</span>
<span class="go">ah yes</span>

<span class="go">dolita [11:11 AM]</span>
<span class="go">some items have to be stored with their serial number</span>
<span class="go">such as phone, washing machine</span>
<span class="go">serial number is a very unique identifier for 1 single unit</span>
<span class="go">which means if i have 10 phones, and i want it tracked in the serial number, there will be 10 lines of inventory record</span>
<span class="go">because each quantity has different serial (in phone it is IMEI)</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [11:12 AM]</span>
<span class="go">ah yes</span>

<span class="go">dolita [11:13 AM]</span>
<span class="go">but people can also opt to track the inventory as non-serial. so to apply non-serial example to the phone,</span>
<span class="go">the inventory record will be 1 line of qty = 10</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [11:14 AM]</span>
<span class="go">ah okay</span>

<span class="go">dolita [11:14 AM]</span>
<span class="go">how do we know if the item has to be tracked as serialised? check the `wms_itemmaster.item_snbound` flag</span>
<span class="go">if it is 1 == manage this SKU&#39;s inventory as serialised items</span>
<span class="go">and the serial number is stored in `wms_sn` table which is linked to `wms_inventory.serial_id`</span>
<span class="go">ok so far?</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [11:16 AM]</span>
<span class="go">ah yes, got it</span>

<span class="go">dolita [11:17 AM]</span>
<span class="go">ok, so lets go back to inbound</span>
<span class="go">https://urbanfox.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/WMS/pages/22249473/WMS+Features</span>
<span class="go">search for `Goods Receiving`</span>
<span class="go">i have listed the 4 main methods of GR, the last one is `Goods Receiving without PO (serialised item)`</span>
<span class="go">so note that.. serialised item has their own receiving page and they should nt be received using the regular non serialised GRN page</span>
<span class="go">remember that day we go to warehouse</span>
<span class="go">zaid was doing receival of headphones</span>
<span class="go">?</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [11:20 AM]</span>
<span class="go">ah yes, the two headphones</span>

<span class="go">dolita [11:20 AM]</span>
<span class="go">yep. those headphones are tracked/managed/stored with their serial number</span>
<span class="go">so he was using this page (note: this is staging version of the page he use): https://wms-stag.courex.com.sg/wms/manualreceivescan_customsn.php (edited)</span>
<span class="go">i think you are lucky to come when they are processing serialised item</span>
<span class="go">also note that when we do picking of serial items, what we scan is the serial number, not the item barcode</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [11:23 AM]</span>
<span class="go">ah yes, this is noted.</span>

<span class="go">dolita [11:23 AM]</span>
<span class="go">nice</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [11:25 AM]</span>
<span class="go">this I remembered,, they actually scan the serial number, have printed the serial number, after that she passed to the other person with printed serial to packed the item (edited)</span>

<span class="go">dolita [11:25 AM]</span>
<span class="go">what she print is the receiver address label actually</span>
<span class="go">and connote of delivery</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [11:26 AM]</span>
<span class="go">ah okay, got it. thanks for correct me :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

<span class="go">dolita [11:26 AM]</span>

<span class="go">shall we talk abt PO now?</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [2:00 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ah yes :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

<span class="go">dolita [2:00 PM]</span>
<span class="go">actually nt as long as earlier</span>
<span class="go">but it is fine</span>
<span class="go">i can show how to reproduce the duplicates</span>
<span class="go">https://urbanfox.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/WMS/pages/222920746/WMS+Dictionary</span>
<span class="go">show you what i wrote abt PO earlier lol</span>
<span class="go">so people usually pair PO and SO</span>
<span class="go">PO is the order we create when we want to bring goods into inventory</span>
<span class="go">so for WMS-300, can you open wms-stag?</span>
<span class="go">or your local-wms</span>
<span class="go">then go to times</span>
<span class="go">this also can</span>
<span class="go">got 1 open PO</span>
<span class="go">duplicated</span>
<span class="go">well user dont normally do what we do just now</span>
<span class="go">but when network bad, or laggy, they can also accidentally click twice</span>
<span class="go">(you try click twice)</span>
<span class="go">i nv able to reproduce the twice clicking prob</span>
<span class="go">coz nv click fast enough</span>
<span class="go">this is purchase order</span>
<span class="go">when goods come, we click go to receiving to receive it</span>
<span class="go">but got 1 more way to do so</span>
<span class="go">that is the same form from where we click &quot;go to goods receiving&quot; (compare the URL)</span>
<span class="go">both go to same page</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [2:10 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ah yes</span>

<span class="go">dolita [2:10 PM]</span>
<span class="go">(from &#39;goods receiving&#39; menu or from PO detail then click &quot;go to goods receiving&quot;)</span>
<span class="go">just fyi</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [2:10 PM]</span>
<span class="go">noted</span>

<span class="go">dolita [2:10 PM]</span>
<span class="go">pls continue your testing hehe</span>
<span class="go">btw when i left, you shld rename 2202 user.username and change the password (and maybe let nizam you changed ald) (edited)</span>
<span class="go">coz if nt when nizam do clean up, he will list my account for cleaning lol</span>
<span class="go">altho if he list my account for cleaning.. you can still put back the stuffs</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [2:14 PM]</span>
<span class="go">yeah, noted @dolita :cry:</span>

<span class="go">dolita [2:15 PM]</span>
<span class="go">dun be sad</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [2:16 PM]</span>
<span class="go">yep, hehe</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [3:34 PM]</span>
<span class="go">hi @dolita, the `Reference DO#` = `list_Reference` , is the unique one right? (edited)</span>

<span class="go">dolita [3:36 PM]</span>
<span class="go">in GRN, it is nt unique</span>
<span class="go">actually quite a lot GRN use same reference DO# (/ `list_Reference`)</span>
<span class="go">:point_up_2: if im nt wrong</span>
<span class="go">and actually in SO it is also not enforced. only when we do upload then enforced</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [3:38 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ah because the `list_ReferenceMisc` is have some empty. mhm, I&#39;ll check the diagram :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

<span class="go">dolita [3:41 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ya `list_ReferenceMist` is optional</span>
<span class="go">if you looking to stop duplicate, shld cross check PO</span>
<span class="go">remember we cannot receive more than what is listed in PO</span>
<span class="go">btw there is a support ticket OMSS-511</span>
<span class="go">are you able to take care of it?</span>
<span class="go">the requester is danielle</span>
<span class="go">nikki talked to me, she said danielle has UF DP account (but she nv give us the account) :thinking_face:</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [3:43 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ah yes I can take care (edited)</span>

<span class="go">dolita [3:43 PM]</span>
<span class="go">maybe you add nikki as participant</span>
<span class="go">ask them to give</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [3:43 PM]</span>
<span class="go">yep, I just wondering, because she needs to register to UF DP</span>

<span class="go">dolita [3:44 PM]</span>
<span class="go">danielle want full access, we will give her all WMS ACL except `wms_pickpack_admin` (nobody shld have that except warehouse/operation head like qiuling/ david) (edited)</span>
<span class="go">btw nikki passed the account ald</span>
<span class="go">tell her dont have that username, and tell her what usernames are there</span>
<span class="go">actually shld reply in ticket</span>
<span class="go">but up to you</span>
<span class="go">there&#39;re 3 emails</span>
<span class="go">eh wait</span>
<span class="go">shld say &quot;username&quot; (edited)</span>
<span class="go">`there&#39;re have 3 username` i thought shld be `there&#39;re 3 username`? (edited)</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [3:58 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ahaha.. sorry</span>

<span class="go">dolita [3:58 PM]</span>
<span class="go">no worries</span>
<span class="go">sometime on some day they will msgs and go pushy (edited)</span>
<span class="go">you shld try to remain calm and dont get affected</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [3:59 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ah yes.. hehe</span>

<span class="go">dolita [3:59 PM]</span>
<span class="go">those ppl ah..</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [3:59 PM]</span>
<span class="go">actually, I have grammar error, hehee</span>

<span class="go">dolita [3:59 PM]</span>
<span class="go">everything also urgent.. but it is nt really urgent</span>
<span class="go">still can edit</span>
<span class="go">but email sent out ald</span>
<span class="go">and if anyone ask you to do support directly (either hangout or slack or email)</span>
<span class="go">ask them to create JIRA ticket in OMSS</span>
<span class="go">tht is our SOP</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [4:00 PM]</span>
<span class="go">yes, noted.</span>

<span class="go">dolita [4:01 PM]</span>
<span class="go">like ty said if they cant even take time to create JIRA, maybe their issue not worth our care?</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [4:01 PM]</span>
<span class="go">just like De Silva, but I didn&#39;t notice, she have some message to me.</span>

<span class="go">dolita [4:01 PM]</span>
<span class="go">but there are real urgent cases that affect operations/ very critical</span>
<span class="go">is she also philipino?</span>
<span class="go">frm the name?</span>
<span class="go">lol ok</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [4:05 PM]</span>
<span class="go">yep, ahhaha</span>

<span class="go">dolita [4:05 PM]</span>
<span class="go">anyway i think while waiting you can create the CALL first?</span>
<span class="go">then later add in the UID?</span>
<span class="go">the CALL SP queries</span>
<span class="go">btw also maybe we also need ping nikki to tell her abt the prob</span>

<span class="go">but most time users need tell us which account they want to clone</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [4:15 PM]</span>
<span class="go">maybe I will asked first what user they follow.</span>

<span class="go">dolita [4:15 PM]</span>
<span class="go">yep normally need ask</span>
<span class="go">but danielle here request for full access (edited)</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [4:16 PM]</span>

<span class="go">ah okay</span>

<span class="go">dolita [4:16 PM]</span>
<span class="go">so full access constitute what you noted down</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [4:17 PM]</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [5:04 PM]</span>
<span class="go">btw Raj, I have a question to me..</span>

<span class="go">dolita [5:05 PM]</span>
<span class="go">oh what is it?</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [5:06 PM]</span>
<span class="go">he said, when an order created and pushed to TMS, we are required to have a delivery date?</span>

<span class="go">dolita [5:06 PM]</span>
<span class="go">we always give delivery date :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [5:06 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ah okay. :wink:</span>

<span class="go">dolita [5:07 PM]</span>
<span class="go">dont really understand the concern though</span>
<span class="go">cause all the TMS order created from legacy got delivery date</span>
<span class="go">WMS use legacy API to create and that one gt delivery date</span>
<span class="go">oh ya btw</span>
<span class="go">if we go to https://dp.urbanfox.asia/ and click login</span>

<span class="go">hi @dolita, can we create a dashboard that can search an username and then setup the User ACL, so we do not query directly to the mysql client. What do you think?</span>

<span class="go">dolita [10:27 AM]</span>
<span class="go">TMS is doing that dashboard</span>
<span class="go">you try ask them whats the progress?</span>
<span class="go">or rather</span>
<span class="go">ask them if they doing that dashboard</span>
<span class="go">wait ah</span>

<span class="go">dolita [10:36 AM]</span>
<span class="go">the item barcode not filled</span>
<span class="go">they shld fill it</span>
<span class="go">they want us to give them _admin acl because their products dont have barcode or what not (edited)</span>
<span class="go">i feel like not so proper because whole warehouse are forced to enter barcode</span>
<span class="go">what i just show you is how the pick ticket should be used</span>
<span class="go">so you can show nikki with barcode, that is how pick ticket work</span>
<span class="go">after it is scanned, we actually can edit the qty</span>
<span class="go">refresh</span>
<span class="go">scan barcode</span>
<span class="go">if they are pickpack_admin doesnt need barcode, can just enter qty like my account</span>
<span class="go">i actually removed that from myself for a while cause majority users are not pickpack_admin</span>
<span class="go">there is a reason for having that constraint</span>
<span class="go">it is to ensure correct picking of item</span>
<span class="go">did she ask for the pickpack_admin acl?</span>
<span class="go">ok then dont need tell her that hehe</span>
<span class="go">coz nt fully picked yet</span>
<span class="go">ya they cant scan. we just added the barcode (need show her that)</span>
<span class="go">i mean just now no barcode right, we just added it</span>
<span class="go">in item master</span>
<span class="go">btw i wonder how she picked 4 units? if no barcode</span>
<span class="go">i see wrong</span>
<span class="go">nothing is picked</span>
<span class="go">if you click `record pick` now, ltr cant show her how pick ticket work? (edited)</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [10:54 AM]</span>
<span class="go">its okay lah, hehee</span>

<span class="go">dolita [10:55 AM]</span>
<span class="go">haha good good</span>
<span class="go">did you guys talk about pickpack_admin?</span>
<span class="go">shall i bring it up to #wms that most users will not get pickpack_admin?</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [10:58 AM]</span>
<span class="go">nope, I discussed a regular user, how can they directly to packlist, but I mention its an option to fill-up the item sku in inventory, if she can&#39;t scan the barcode.</span>

<span class="go">dolita [10:58 AM]</span>
<span class="go">oh ok</span>
<span class="go">when i introduce wms from beginning</span>
<span class="go">i shld have shown that (lol)</span>
<span class="go">but coz fellow dev, i just use the easy way to show</span>
<span class="go">shown the having to scan barcode in pick ticket i mean</span>
<span class="go">if im showing to regular user, that is what i will show (scan barcode first)</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [11:02 AM]</span>
<span class="go">hehehe.. maybe I can mention to her later. about this one. btw, she asked what is `SO Remarks (for WMS only)` is for?</span>

<span class="go">dolita [11:02 AM]</span>
<span class="go">mention what to her?</span>
<span class="go">so there are 3 Remarks boxes in WMS</span>
<span class="go">`Remarks (Additional Shipping Instruction)` == the remarks that get carried forward to TMS</span>
<span class="go">`SO Remarks (for WMS only)` == the remarks that will stay in WMS, eg &quot;pack with bubble wrap&quot;</span>
<span class="go">both of them are visible to clients</span>
<span class="go">`SO Admin Note (not visible to WMS Customers)`  == the remarks for internal ops usage</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [11:07 AM]</span>
<span class="go">got it :wink:</span>

<span class="go">dolita [11:07 AM]</span>
<span class="go">the remarks are explained briefly in https://urbanfox.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/WMS/pages/222920746/WMS+Dictionary (edited)</span>

<span class="go">i wanted to stay until master come back</span>
<span class="go">but not my call</span>
<span class="go">sorry for that</span>
<span class="go">going to have to manage with master being remote for now (edited)</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [11:22 AM]</span>
<span class="go">hehehe..  ah yes.</span>
<span class="go">also you are master too.</span>
<span class="go">hehehe</span>

<span class="go">dolita [11:23 AM]</span>
<span class="go">lol</span>
<span class="go">just in wms</span>
<span class="go">i need to show you more things :grimacing:</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [11:23 AM]</span>
<span class="go">ah yes..</span>
<span class="go">maybe we can discuss after lunch, what do you think?</span>

<span class="go">dolita [11:24 AM]</span>
<span class="go">yep it is good</span>
<span class="go">btw do you want to select PRs for deployments?</span>
<span class="go">thinking tues deployment</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [11:27 AM]</span>
<span class="go">I&#39;ll review first, maybe tomorrow I can decide which PR are okay, ehhee.. its okay to you?</span>

<span class="go">dolita [11:34 AM]</span>
<span class="go">yup it is ok</span>
<span class="go">if it helps, we will talk about the `things` tmr</span>
<span class="go">btw sorry to interrupt. last night raj asked me about the delivery date</span>
<span class="go">he asked you about it, but he realise he also need the pick up date</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [11:37 AM]</span>
<span class="go">ah, okay, ehehe..</span>
<span class="go">I think, he already okay now.</span>

<span class="go">dolita [11:38 AM]</span>
<span class="go">```Raj [6:28 PM]</span>
<span class="go">So I wanted know if the customers provide the pickup date when they create orders from WMS?</span>
<span class="go">Actually Jasper asked you about the delivery date, but i needed both the delivery date as well as the pickup date.</span>
<span class="go">dolita [6:30 PM]</span>
<span class="go">usually no. but the goods are stored in warehouse, so what warehouse ops do is select today as pick up and select delivery as per agreement</span>
<span class="go">i see</span>
<span class="go">when TMS order created from WMS --&gt; TMS, they always have delivery date</span>
<span class="go">so i told him im nt sure whats the concern</span>
<span class="go">if there is issue, maybe you let me know which OL/ML?</span>
<span class="go">cause some customers have different processing</span>
<span class="go">Raj [6:32 PM]</span>
<span class="go">No, we don&#39;t have any issue.</span>
<span class="go">We are building a new billing portal, hence we want to make sure we are capturing everything right.</span>
<span class="go">dolita [6:32 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ah ok</span>
<span class="go">there are 2 ways WMS --&gt; TMS can happen</span>
<span class="go">1) via WMS interface, which I just described</span>
<span class="go">2) via so-sync script, which is an automated script</span>
<span class="go">(a moment please while i check)</span>
<span class="go">Raj [6:34 PM]</span>
<span class="go">Sure</span>
<span class="go">dolita [6:36 PM]</span>
<span class="go">so in the automated script, the pickup date default to the date the process initiated</span>
<span class="go">delivery date is 1) if it is provided in SO, use it, 2) if not provided, it will be next working day```</span>
<span class="go">(edited)</span>
<span class="go">ya just want to update you what happening</span>
<span class="go">hopefully the above is clear (that is wall of text)</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [11:41 AM]</span>
<span class="go">yep, that&#39;s clear. :wink: Thank you @dolita (edited)</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [9:40 AM]</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [9:41 AM]</span>
<span class="go">ah yeah sure, but can you give some background later about the task :wink:</span>
<span class="go">so I have an idea</span>

<span class="go">but i want you to know that there are a lot to brief and i am not sure how you can take it</span>
<span class="go">looking at your PO PR</span>
<span class="go">i already said that is not correct. not sure why you still go on to do like that</span>
<span class="go">your focus now should be knowing how WMS work</span>
<span class="go">(and we still need to clear all your outstanding PRs...)</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [9:47 AM]</span>
<span class="go">ah yes, I&#39;m wrong with that. I actually pushing the reference id to be unique to fill-up the field.</span>

<span class="go">dolita [9:47 AM]</span>
<span class="go">you cant change that cause it is not supposed to be unique</span>
<span class="go">once you push that change, consider what going to happen?</span>
<span class="go">if people used to reuse the reference id for several GRN, then they suddenly cant do that, they will surely find you</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [10:40 AM]</span>
<span class="go">hi @dolita, nizam asked me about the production server, this the name of our prod server right wms.courex.com.sg also he request me about the public key ? Do we have?</span>

<span class="go">dolita [10:42 AM]</span>
<span class="go">i think he mean you need to access production server and he asking you for your public key</span>
<span class="go">our access to (legacy) servers are regulated using SSH public private key</span>
<span class="go">you need to generate your own key and pass nizam the public one</span>
<span class="go">keep the private one yourself</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [10:44 AM]</span>
<span class="go">the one that I generated in my butbucket?</span>

<span class="go">dolita [10:45 AM]</span>
<span class="go">and nope, that is not access to wms.courex.com.sg ... after you settled these, i will be able to show you where to login to access some other apps</span>
<span class="go">like this one is it https://bitbucket.org/account/user/&lt;your account&gt;/ssh-keys/ ?</span>
<span class="go">https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/set-up-an-ssh-key-728138079.html</span>
<span class="go">i think yes</span>
<span class="go">but im nt sure if it is alright to reuse that same key pair</span>
<span class="go">you shld have SSH set in your machine i think</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [10:47 AM]</span>
<span class="go">how about this one</span>
<span class="go">```how abt ec2?</span>
<span class="go">i means servers?```</span>
<span class="go">he asked me about this things?</span>
<span class="go">name of our production server that we used.</span>

<span class="go">dolita [10:49 AM]</span>
<span class="go">oh</span>
<span class="go">you need access to...</span>
<span class="go">```sv-production-bastion</span>
<span class="go">sv-production-app-storeviva</span>
<span class="go">sv-production-app-internal```</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [10:52 AM]</span>
<span class="go">this is our servers?</span>

<span class="go">dolita [10:52 AM]</span>
<span class="go">actually i think only need to set your key at sv-production-bastion</span>
<span class="go">it is servers for legacy stuffs...</span>
<span class="go">wms itself is in beanstalk</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [10:54 AM]</span>

<span class="go">dolita [10:58 AM]</span>
<span class="go">ok tell him that 3</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [10:59 AM]</span>
<span class="go">okay, thanks because I&#39;m unsure.</span>

<span class="go">dolita [10:59 AM]</span>
<span class="go">+ beanstalk of courex-wms? (edited)</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [10:59 AM]</span>
<span class="go">??</span>

<span class="go">dolita [11:00 AM]</span>
<span class="go">his qn is which servers in production you will access</span>
<span class="go">we have legacies EC2 that is managed via SSH inside</span>
<span class="go">```sv-production-app-storeviva</span>
<span class="go">sv-production-app-internal```</span>
<span class="go">and to access those 2, must go via `sv-production-bastion`</span>
<span class="go">and we have wms.courex.com.sg which is in beanstalk</span>
<span class="go">im not sure if his qn also mean the beanstalks</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [11:04 AM]</span>
<span class="go">ah okay, got it.</span>

<span class="go">dolita [11:17 AM]</span>
<span class="go">i think i need to show you the user-staffs db.. -.-</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [11:18 AM]</span>
<span class="go">ah yeah sure</span>

<span class="go">dolita [11:19 AM]</span>
<span class="go">nah it is ok</span>
<span class="go">i will pass you some query first</span>

<span class="go">dolita [11:24 AM]</span>
<span class="go">```SELECT user.*, staffs.StaffID, staffs.courex_uid FROM user LEFT JOIN staffs ON staffs.courex_uid = user.UID WHERE staffs.StaffID = 724916```</span>
<span class="go">(edited)</span>
<span class="go">is it clear?</span>
<span class="go">but i notice puah gave 3 ppl ID. 1st one she gave the staffID, 2nd &amp; 3rd one is the user.UID</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [11:31 AM]</span>
<span class="go">ah okay, got it. the missing username is on the staffs table (edited)</span>
<span class="go">but why?</span>

<span class="go">dolita [11:32 AM]</span>
<span class="go">username is in user table</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [11:33 AM]</span>
<span class="go">yeah, i mean have separated table?</span>

<span class="go">dolita [11:35 AM]</span>
<span class="go">when we register from https://dp.urbanfox.asia/delivery-person/signup 3 records are created in 3 tables, ie `user`, `staffs`, `mobiledevice`</span>
<span class="go">dp.urbanfox.asia</span>
<span class="go">Urbanfox DP Signup</span>
<span class="go">Urbanfox DP Signup</span>
<span class="go">user &amp; staffs are linked like my query</span>
<span class="go">so in the past we always refer to staffs users by their staffs.StaffID (edited)</span>
<span class="go">but over time, we only use `user` table primarily (edited)</span>
<span class="go">so there are 2 things you can do</span>
<span class="go">1) is standardise. eg if people give you staffID, ask for their UID / username instead (edited)</span>
<span class="go">or 2) you try search the info yourself</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [11:43 AM]</span>
<span class="go">okay, got it. :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

<span class="go">dolita [11:44 AM]</span>
<span class="go">not sure if you remember but i mentioned danielle `user` does not have `staffs` counterpart</span>
<span class="go">hmm ok nvm im wrong</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [11:46 AM]</span>
<span class="go">ah okay, I&#39;m checking the https://urbanfox.atlassian.net/browse/OMSS-511</span>

<span class="go">dolita [11:47 AM]</span>
<span class="go">yep</span>
<span class="go">i search the username and found the UID</span>
<span class="go">then do `SELECT staffs.StaffID, staffs.courex_uid, staffs.Email FROM user LEFT JOIN staffs ON staffs.courex_uid = user.UID WHERE user.UID = 16199`</span>
<span class="go">i thought i will see null, but actually got correct entries there</span>
<span class="go">so i was wrong lol</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [11:49 AM]</span>
<span class="go">btw, can you help me, what nizam referring , is he needs my private ssh that I created in my bitbucket account or the ssh key in our server.</span>
<span class="go">Screenshot from 2018-12-07 11-48-22.png</span>


<span class="go">dolita [11:50 AM]</span>
<span class="go">he need your public key</span>
<span class="go">you shld nv give ppl your private key</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [11:50 AM]</span>
<span class="go">yeah my ssh public key</span>

<span class="go">dolita [11:50 AM]</span>
<span class="go">just give him your public key will do</span>
<span class="go">he will add your key to bastion</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [11:52 AM]</span>
<span class="go">I think we can&#39;t reuse the ssh public key.</span>

<span class="go">dolita [11:53 AM]</span>
<span class="go">then you got to create new one</span>
<span class="go">and manage 2 keys in your machine</span>
<span class="go">can i talk abt this in the channel with @ty ? (edited)</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [11:55 AM]</span>

<span class="go">if that is WMS--&gt;TMS, they need to enable the `Enable External Tracking</span>

<span class="go">Posted in #tmsDec 7thView message</span>
<span class="go">i think this is a feature i talk until my mouth foaming but nobody _know_ abt it lol</span>
<span class="go">altho i told ops side once and they nv ask me abt it again</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [2:49 PM]</span>
<span class="go">hi @dolita, can we create a model folder for using table queries for now we have different queries in the different files, so we can manage the queries.. or do you have some suggestion or separated file? (edited)</span>

<span class="go">dolita [2:50 PM]</span>
<span class="go">that time master talked abt it</span>
<span class="go">wait ah</span>
<span class="go">https://urbanfox.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/WMS/pages/55312442/Roadmap+WMS</span>
<span class="go">2018-Q4-2</span>
<span class="go">basically we will create a folder + files for queries</span>
<span class="go">i ald started</span>
<span class="go">`wms/data_access/outbound_query.php`</span>
<span class="go">(is that what u mean?)</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [2:52 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ah yes, :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

<span class="go">dolita [2:52 PM]</span>
<span class="go">so my thinking is, `outbound_query`, `inbound_query`, `inventory_query`</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [2:53 PM]</span>
<span class="go">so we can call the function only instead directly on the php files.</span>

<span class="go">dolita [2:53 PM]</span>
<span class="go">yup</span>
<span class="go">and over time the data_access will be replaced with wms api</span>
<span class="go">meaning inside the functions, instead of direct queries, it will be API call (edited)</span>
<span class="go">we wont need to change the code, just the functions</span>
<span class="go">lol that is frm aug/ sept</span>
<span class="go">and until now i only managed to add that (and forgot about it ald :disappointed: )</span>
<span class="go">but im kinda sure the data_access is 1 of the way, moving forward. do talk to ty abt it when he is back (edited)</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [2:57 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ah yes, just like MVC framework.</span>

<span class="go">dolita [2:58 PM]</span>
<span class="go">yup</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [2:58 PM]</span>
<span class="go">also all logical function should be on controller and separated to the model queries.</span>

<span class="go">dolita [2:59 PM]</span>
<span class="go">do it step by step ^^</span>
<span class="go">before you change anything, make sure you know how everything works first</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [3:01 PM]</span>
<span class="go">I can create one today, I just rewriting the queries report_transhistory.php because I noticed when fetch all the records with jquerys, its a kinda a laggy to search the user.</span>

<span class="go">dolita [3:02 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ok</span>
<span class="go">add jira task for that?</span>
<span class="go">lets talk to ty abt the controller?</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [3:02 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ah yes</span>
<span class="go">btw, I just improving the https://bitbucket.org/courex/courex-wms/pull-requests/94</span>
<span class="go">I just tested so I notice that</span>

<span class="go">dolita [3:03 PM]</span>
<span class="go">coz need to ensure the changes fit the big picture</span>
<span class="go">oh lol</span>
<span class="go">do note though as you add these, set aside some time to listen to my boring talks abt WMS &amp; cronies :laughing:</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [3:07 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ah what do you mean cronies, my vocabulary is limited, ahahaha</span>

<span class="go">dolita [3:08 PM]</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [3:13 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ahhaha.. got it</span>

<span class="go">dolita [3:13 PM]</span>
<span class="go">jasper, the `Enable External Tracking` is disabled by default</span>
<span class="go">people need to enable it, eg if they create new account (edited)</span>
<span class="go">you know right?</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [3:13 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ah yes</span>

<span class="go">dolita [3:14 PM]</span>
<span class="go">you understand what it is for?</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [3:15 PM]</span>
<span class="go">nope.</span>
<span class="go">did you already discussed or I forgot?</span>

<span class="go">dolita [3:16 PM]</span>
<span class="go">i discussed</span>
<span class="go">ok</span>
<span class="go">so if it is enabled, when user create TMS order from packing list, the `SO Reference` will be used as TMS external tracking</span>
<span class="go">if nt enabled, then no external tracking</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [3:18 PM]</span>
<span class="go">can you show me, how its works? Can I seat beside you?</span>

<span class="go">dolita [3:18 PM]</span>
<span class="go">yup</span>
<span class="go">come</span>

<span class="go">dolita [3:25 PM]</span>
<span class="go">that is hold stock feature</span>
<span class="go">i picked from L4-RM4 so after record pick, qty deducted by 1, and hold stock removed</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [3:28 PM]</span>
<span class="go">this weekend, I need to revire all of things so we can discussed and create a list of question. So we can discuss by Tuesday</span>

<span class="go">dolita [3:28 PM]</span>
<span class="go">you mean sat sun mon you revise?</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [3:29 PM]</span>
<span class="go">I mean review all things you brief to me</span>
<span class="go">and just create a list of question. so I&#39;m ready to have question for you bt tueday</span>
<span class="go">for now, I just working the PR&#39;s</span>

<span class="go">dolita [3:30 PM]</span>
<span class="go">haven show you that enable thing</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [3:30 PM]</span>
<span class="go">tracking number</span>

<span class="go">dolita [3:30 PM]</span>
<span class="go">lol</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [3:35 PM]</span>
<span class="go">the first discussion ahahah</span>

<span class="go">dolita [3:35 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ya, xinyun also got do that</span>
<span class="go">in wh trip</span>
<span class="go">nt sure if you got access to dp-stag.urbanfox.asia</span>
<span class="go">if not, either copy the acl yrself (it is same field) or ask tms folks help</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [3:40 PM]</span>
<span class="go">let me check again the diffrence the tracking number givem</span>

<span class="go">dolita [3:41 PM]</span>
<span class="go">i created when the option is enabled then the SO ref got carried forward</span>
<span class="go">then i disabled that settings and create another one, this time my SO ref got ignored</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [3:43 PM]</span>
<span class="go">got it :wink:</span>

<span class="go">dolita [3:43 PM]</span>
<span class="go">it is settings that only work at WMS</span>
<span class="go">if people use the so-processor-script (so-sync) the SO reference always carried to TMS as external tracking</span>
<span class="go">so-sync is automated script</span>
<span class="go">im checking for new open SO then create pmq for it</span>
<span class="go">pmq is our message broker</span>
<span class="go">MQ?</span>
<span class="go">message queue?</span>
<span class="go">SO-sync (SO-processor) poll the pmq for orders to be processed</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [3:47 PM]</span>
<span class="go">the one you worked in beanstalk</span>

<span class="go">dolita [3:47 PM]</span>
<span class="go">i just managed to put it up in beanstalk</span>
<span class="go">yup</span>
<span class="go">im creating the PMQ now</span>
<span class="go">anyway dont worry abt so-sync for now</span>
<span class="go">it is nodejs</span>
<span class="go">but the process is same, create pick, pack then tms order</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [3:51 PM]</span>
<span class="go">I&#39;ll back to you on Tuesday</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [4:29 PM]</span>
<span class="go">hi @dolita, what do you think with this one http://php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php</span>

<span class="go">dolita [4:33 PM]</span>
<span class="go">https://www.yudiz.com/mysql-vs-mysqli-vs-pdo/</span>
<span class="go">mysqli supports procedural (easier to transition frm `mysql`) and also support async..</span>
<span class="go">we have chosen `mysqli` so there is no need to think about switching to PDO at this moment</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [4:34 PM]</span>
<span class="go">no, I just reading with this</span>
<span class="go">no plan for swicthing to PDO :grin:</span>
<span class="go">I just browsing php function and look at this one</span>

<span class="go">dolita [4:36 PM]</span>
<span class="go">we will not be rewriting WMS at leisure pace (new things will keep coming in), so it is not going to be easy to rewrite (in fact refactoring &amp; reusing existing service (eg the AWS API gateway) favoured)</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [4:36 PM]</span>
<span class="go">hehehe</span>

<span class="go">dolita [4:36 PM]</span>
<span class="go">hehe ok</span>
<span class="go">i had the same qn 3 yrs ago (PDO or mysqli)</span>
<span class="go">asked senior back then</span>
<span class="go">anyway if using wms-api, the queries will be handled in typescript</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [4:38 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ah yes, you already mention, all API&#39;s calls.</span>

<span class="go">dolita [4:38 PM]</span>
<span class="go">but to me the biggest win is `mysqli_` &amp; `mysql_` are similar, so it is easier to write new query without sacrificing too much time</span>
<span class="go">ya</span>
<span class="go">so if you notice, in wms we ald use both mysql_ and mysqli_ (edited)</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [4:41 PM]</span>
<span class="go">yep,, I just wondering at first, why two. but I already got your point with this.</span>
<span class="go">hehehe</span>

<span class="go">dolita [4:41 PM]</span>
<span class="go">hehe</span>
<span class="go">so if you write any new query now, do use mysqli_</span>
<span class="go">you got use PDO before?</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [4:42 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ah not yet..</span>

<span class="go">dolita [4:42 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ic ic</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [4:44 PM]</span>
<span class="go">yep, hehehe</span>

<span class="go">dolita [4:44 PM]</span>
<span class="go">btw gentle reminder to reply the OMSS-516 (edited)</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [4:45 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ah yes, thank you</span>

<span class="go">dolita [4:45 PM]</span>
<span class="go">in general if ops got support request, theirs usually quite urgent coz they need to fulfil orders quickly</span>
<span class="go">basically if it is abt completing real time job, we need to put more attention to it</span>
<span class="go">while if it is abt setting up for testing etc, they can afford a bit lag</span>
<span class="go">and ops usually dont set up for testing</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [4:47 PM]</span>
<span class="go">yeah, correct. I&#39;m currently setup his access now.</span>

<span class="go">dolita [4:47 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ah but puah havent said follow who right?</span>
<span class="go">i think got some miscomm :grimacing:</span>
<span class="go">anyway when the new engineer come in you guys can rotate the support :blush:</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [4:49 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ah yes.. do you have any updates ?</span>

<span class="go">dolita [4:50 PM]</span>
<span class="go">nope i dont. lets ask ty?</span>
<span class="go">i think got 1 guy come in nxt week for tms</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [4:51 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ah yeah.. this coming Monday</span>

<span class="go">dolita [4:52 PM]</span>
<span class="go">but it does look like the next wms engineer will not come in before 16</span>
<span class="go">so you will have to train him/her :grimacing:</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [4:53 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ah yes, I expected for that happen.</span>

<span class="go">dolita [4:53 PM]</span>
<span class="go">i have the intro slide if that helps (shared with you on your first week)</span>

<span class="go">ah sure, its helps me a lot, so I can back read, when I forgot something. Its that okay for you or double work?</span>
<span class="go">Sorry for this one. :grimacing:</span>

<span class="go">dolita [5:04 PM]</span>

<span class="go">dont worry abt the grammar/ clarity, i can add on later</span>
<span class="go">add as much screenshots as you can :grin:</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [5:07 PM]</span>

<span class="go">hi @dolita, nikki asked me again about the  `Enable External Tracking` I told her when enabled we used the TMS tracker right?</span>
<span class="go">btw, also asked if WMS have a connected fields that have connected to TMS, something soft of., so I mention `Enable External Tracking` right ?</span>

<span class="go">dolita [4:04 PM]</span>
<span class="go">the `Enable External Tracking` is so that we can create TMS order with tracking that is taken from the SO reference</span>
<span class="go">as for connected fields.. you should take a look at managepack and see what fields we sent to TMS via the XML API payload.. (edited)</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [4:09 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ah okay. maybe we can discuss to Nikki because have something changes in WMS and also I&#39;n sure about the functionality. She walk through yesterday but I have no idea some connected fields in TMS. (edited)</span>

<span class="go">dolita [4:10 PM]</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [4:10 PM]</span>
<span class="go">hehehe</span>

<span class="go">dolita [4:10 PM]</span>
<span class="go">actually rather than &quot;connected&quot; fields</span>
<span class="go">more correct to say &quot;which fields got sent to TMS&quot;</span>
<span class="go">we dont connect to TMS directly (or try not to) (edited)</span>

<span class="go">1 is check yourself. there should be a wms_picklist_item_draft row if you search for that pick ticket</span>

<span class="go">from 29nov-20 dec</span>
<span class="go">take a look at the date left</span>

<span class="go">and start new one from backlog</span>
<span class="go">you want try with this one?</span>
<span class="go">since today is thursday</span>

<span class="go">if yes then complete it</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [10:51 AM]</span>
<span class="go">so its okay to move to next sprint.</span>

<span class="go">dolita [10:51 AM]</span>
<span class="go">it will auto move</span>
<span class="go">ideally we create restrospective</span>
<span class="go">but not much things to note, so i dont do that</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [10:53 AM]</span>
<span class="go">what is Retrospective time first?</span>

<span class="go">dolita [10:53 AM]</span>
<span class="go">it is noting down what happen during that sprint</span>
<span class="go">what can be improved</span>
<span class="go">and what good thing happened (edited)</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [10:54 AM]</span>
<span class="go">okay got it :slightly_smiling_face:</span>
<span class="go">how can I set the date?</span>

<span class="go">dolita [10:55 AM]</span>

<span class="go">dolita [10:57 AM]</span>
<span class="go">remember to do that every 2 weeks</span>
<span class="go">so..</span>
<span class="go">if you working on a task, set the sprint &amp; label</span>
<span class="go">for label, we refer to roadmap</span>
<span class="go">label is TY requirement</span>
<span class="go">so must add label (edited)</span>
<span class="go">can you open a task you doing now?</span>
<span class="go">can you open WMS roadmap?</span>
<span class="go">so if got new task, add the 2018-Qx-x thing to label and shift it to active sprint</span>
<span class="go">otherwise it limit the tasks visibility</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [11:00 AM]</span>
<span class="go">okay, got it :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

<span class="go">right now it is in sprint 999</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [11:13 AM]</span>
<span class="go">I think, just retain this one, I&#39;ll edit if I have correct name for that, hehe..</span>

<span class="go">dolita [11:13 AM]</span>
<span class="go">we cant edit the sprint name, thats why it is in 999</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [11:19 AM]</span>
<span class="go">mhm, maybe just retain this one.</span>

<span class="go">dolita [11:19 AM]</span>
<span class="go">ok</span>

<span class="go">dolita [11:43 AM]</span>
<span class="go">frederick said move interview to 5pm</span>
<span class="go">so you want continue?</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [11:44 AM]</span>
<span class="go">yeah sure :slightly_smiling_face:</span>
<span class="go">how to deploy WMS</span>

<span class="go">dolita [11:45 AM]</span>
<span class="go">ok</span>
<span class="go">i got write smth abt it ytd</span>
<span class="go">https://bitbucket.org/courex/courex-wms/src/master/ (edited)</span>
<span class="go">in the readme</span>
<span class="go">we go through this together when deploying your PRs?</span>
<span class="go">but do we need to involve QC?</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [11:47 AM]</span>
<span class="go">ah yes,</span>

<span class="go">dolita [11:47 AM]</span>
<span class="go">if involve qc, they need do fast check</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [11:47 AM]</span>
<span class="go">thanks for this</span>
<span class="go">i think, this aready an instruction, so no worries</span>

<span class="go">dolita [11:47 AM]</span>
<span class="go">yep i added</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [11:47 AM]</span>
<span class="go">okay lah</span>
<span class="go">JML upload (maybe)</span>

<span class="go">dolita [11:48 AM]</span>
<span class="go">okay</span>
<span class="go">can you open ytd write up?</span>
<span class="go">got pdf inside</span>
<span class="go">that is the interface. we need login to JML portal to see</span>
<span class="go">and need JML documents to try</span>
<span class="go">so normally the upload part dont have isssue</span>
<span class="go">they cannot reupload if the SO reference ald used</span>
<span class="go">and normally the error msg is quite clear in the upload side</span>
<span class="go">so after upload, jml need to submit job to be processed</span>
<span class="go">why we do that?</span>
<span class="go">it is coz JML dont realy use wms for pick and pack</span>
<span class="go">they just want to upload orders, generate their documents and have those orders go to TMS</span>
<span class="go">and that is why we have so-sync script</span>
<span class="go">which ty and me working on now</span>
<span class="go">ty will not know much abt the portal.storeviva part</span>
<span class="go">so that part you take</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [11:54 AM]</span>
<span class="go">so after upload and processed it will sync the order to tms?</span>

<span class="go">dolita [11:54 AM]</span>
<span class="go">after upload &amp; submit to process, so-sync does this</span>
<span class="go">`create pick` -&gt; `create pack` -&gt;  `send request to TMS`</span>
<span class="go">and so TMS order created</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [11:55 AM]</span>
<span class="go">got it :wink:</span>

<span class="go">dolita [11:55 AM]</span>
<span class="go">the purpose of so-sync is for this kind scenario</span>
<span class="go">where clients dont use wms for (physical) pick pack but need the integration to TMS (edited)</span>
<span class="go">most time JML got issue is coz of the script anyway</span>
<span class="go">oh btw got 1 thing to take note</span>
<span class="go">can you open the pdf?</span>
<span class="go">you try login portal-stag.storeviva using JML credential</span>
<span class="go">http://portal-stag.storeviva.com/</span>
<span class="go">i happened to change their password in staging db</span>
<span class="go">try this `jmldirect` and `1429178791`</span>
<span class="go">it only works for this week though lol</span>
<span class="go">that is their 3 documents</span>
<span class="go">that page content is that screenshot</span>
<span class="go">that is list of &quot;active&quot; orders</span>
<span class="go">the orders will stay there until all 3 documents downloaded</span>
<span class="go">after the so-sync finished</span>
<span class="go">that page will show download button</span>
<span class="go">they need to click to download</span>
<span class="go">and all 3 need to be downloaded then the page will clear up</span>
<span class="go">that is the history</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [12:03 PM]</span>
<span class="go">so, already done with this?</span>

<span class="go">dolita [12:03 PM]</span>
<span class="go">yup</span>
<span class="go">got qn?</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [12:04 PM]</span>
<span class="go">why they used JML to upload order? because we have on WMS right?</span>

<span class="go">dolita [12:04 PM]</span>
<span class="go">WMS is UF internal apps</span>
<span class="go">so only UF staffs can use it</span>
<span class="go">(got exception with Ryca but that is all)</span>
<span class="go">every other clients use portal.storeviva.com</span>
<span class="go">JML is one of the client and they use portal.storeviva to upload orders</span>
<span class="go">the grand plan is portal.storeviva.com will be replaced with actual proper IMS (edited)</span>
<span class="go">so dont worry too much abt it</span>
<span class="go">just take note abt it</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [12:06 PM]</span>
<span class="go">okay :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

<span class="go">dolita [12:06 PM]</span>
<span class="go">you want talk abt portal.storeviva.com now?</span>
<span class="go">JML one a bit diff (coz got custom uploader) (edited)</span>
<span class="go">but most of the rest are the same</span>
<span class="go">it is a copy of WMS</span>
<span class="go">(and legacy TMS)</span>
<span class="go">so it is an interface for clients to check their orders</span>
<span class="go">the repo is at https://bitbucket.org/courex/storeviva-portal/src</span>
<span class="go">apps is beanstalked</span>
<span class="go">&quot;symlink&quot;</span>
<span class="go">only WMS part linked like that</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [12:09 PM]</span>
<span class="go">singhealth.storeviva.com</span>

<span class="go">dolita [12:09 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ok so singhealth.. is another customisation</span>
<span class="go">but it is legacy TMS</span>
<span class="go">you try login</span>
<span class="go">with jasper</span>
<span class="go">similar to portal.sv?</span>
<span class="go">but chopped until only delivery part is there</span>
<span class="go">it is legacy tms</span>
<span class="go">and most time we dont need do anything</span>
<span class="go">just for you to note</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [12:11 PM]</span>
<span class="go">okay, got it</span>

<span class="go">dolita [12:11 PM]</span>
<span class="go">https://bitbucket.org/courex/mini-storeviva-portal/</span>
<span class="go">it is sadly nt beanstalked</span>
<span class="go">it is in EC2</span>
<span class="go">you try SSH sv-production-app-storeviva (edited)</span>
<span class="go">okay sorry rem wrong lol</span>
<span class="go">cd apps</span>
<span class="go">or rather</span>
<span class="go">ls apps</span>
<span class="go">git status</span>
<span class="go">check the git origin source</span>
<span class="go">git remote -v</span>
<span class="go">that is where the singhealth apps located</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [12:15 PM]</span>
<span class="go">in our wms app</span>
<span class="go">where is located?</span>

<span class="go">dolita [12:15 PM]</span>
<span class="go">beanstalk</span>
<span class="go">cant ssh like that</span>
<span class="go">lol</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [12:16 PM]</span>
<span class="go">how we can command line when we have some chnages?</span>

<span class="go">dolita [12:16 PM]</span>
<span class="go">we dont need to</span>
<span class="go">coz the scripts take care of it</span>
<span class="go">so just do smth like `make deploy/stag`</span>
<span class="go">then it will use bitbucket-pipeline to deploy to beanstalk</span>
<span class="go">(a lot integrations)</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [12:17 PM]</span>
<span class="go">also have additonal line in composer.json ?</span>

<span class="go">dolita [12:17 PM]</span>
<span class="go">oh ya you will need to update bitbucket-pipeline.yml</span>
<span class="go">we have deploy/stag, so can test it out</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [12:18 PM]</span>
<span class="go">because we need to run composer dumpautoload if we have autload class,</span>
<span class="go">ah okay :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

<span class="go">dolita [12:18 PM]</span>
<span class="go">yup i just remembered</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [12:18 PM]</span>
<span class="go">Difference between wms and www.courex xml</span>

<span class="go">dolita [12:18 PM]</span>
<span class="go">so we got 2 version of legacy tms XML API</span>
<span class="go">the one in www.courex is what we distribute to clients</span>
<span class="go">the one in wms is strictly for UF internal usage</span>
<span class="go">(eg our WMS)</span>
<span class="go">and we got legacy documentation on the xml api</span>
<span class="go">https://storeviva.github.io/</span>
<span class="go">oh lunch time ald?</span>
<span class="go">we dont want people to use xml api so just keep this doc to yourself</span>
<span class="go">and fellow engineers</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [12:21 PM]</span>
<span class="go">okay.. so will continue after lunch</span>
<span class="go">lunch lah</span>

<span class="go">dolita [1:30 PM]</span>
<span class="go">we didnt touch on this just now, but to create new sprint, click this `Create sprint` button (at right side there). (i ald created up to 27)</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [1:45 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ah yes :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [1:55 PM]</span>
<span class="go">hi @dolita, I just mapping the table Outbound table for `Outbound Order - Cancel`  like we did in `Outbound Order - Create` (edited)</span>

<span class="go">dolita [1:56 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ok</span>
<span class="go">mapping table, then?</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [1:56 PM]</span>
<span class="go">I think is a new table for `cancel` (edited)</span>
<span class="go">```{</span>
<span class="go">  order_id: aRequiredString,</span>
<span class="go">  cancel_reason: {                  // (*)</span>

<span class="go">  }</span>
<span class="go">}```</span>

<span class="go">also with `return` (edited)</span>
<span class="go">```{</span>

<span class="go">dolita [1:57 PM]</span>
<span class="go">there is (*) what is stated?</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [1:58 PM]</span>
<span class="go">(*) needs new custom fields table</span>

<span class="go">dolita [1:58 PM]</span>
<span class="go">(sorry cause my memory also hazy, but sounds like you are right. except new table is not called `cancel`)</span>
<span class="go">i think there is some custom table..</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [2:02 PM]</span>
<span class="go">```What about the cancel and return logic in the WMS UI ?</span>

<span class="go">what does it do ?```</span>
<span class="go">from akash</span>

<span class="go">dolita [2:09 PM]</span>
<span class="go">cancel, return, maybe need to discuss with ty about it? as in you, akash &amp; ty</span>

<span class="go">dolita [3:28 PM]</span>
<span class="go">Jasper, can I push PR# 92, 93, 72, 73, to QC? I want to push #94 too but need update the yml</span>

<span class="go">opps, how can I update the yml? yml in the root folder?</span>

<span class="go">dolita [3:38 PM]</span>
<span class="go">i think you need update 3 files</span>
<span class="go">`docker/dev/Dockerfile`, `docker/prod/Dockerfile`, `docker/stag/Dockerfile`</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [4:23 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ah yes @dolita.</span>

<span class="go">hi @dolita, good morning :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

<span class="go">dolita [10:31 AM]</span>
<span class="go">so ah</span>
<span class="go">on OMSS-525</span>
<span class="go">how do you delete it?</span>
<span class="go">i got 2 comments here</span>
<span class="go">can say? lol</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [10:32 AM]</span>
<span class="go">just update the list active to 0</span>
<span class="go">that&#39;s the correct way?</span>

<span class="go">dolita [10:32 AM]</span>
<span class="go">you mean item_active?</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [10:33 AM]</span>
<span class="go">yes</span>

<span class="go">dolita [10:33 AM]</span>
<span class="go">it is</span>
<span class="go">but</span>
<span class="go">1. user has ability to do that themselves (it is kind of hairy for them though)</span>
<span class="go">2. dont act on all their requests. sometime the requests are not valid</span>
<span class="go">case where it can be invalid, 1) user can do it themselves, 2) it is &quot;illegal&quot; procedure</span>
<span class="go">anyway just a comment, since you done ald, nvm ald</span>
<span class="go">there is a counter script for BOM btw</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [10:35 AM]</span>
<span class="go">no its important to me..  can you show me that user have ability to delete the item.</span>
<span class="go">so next time have a request again, I&#39;m referring this</span>
<span class="go">wait i&#39;ll check</span>

<span class="go">dolita [10:37 AM]</span>
<span class="go">user can deactivate if item stock is 0</span>

<span class="go">dolita [10:37 AM]</span>
<span class="go">the thing about BOM is they cannot control the stock directly. BOM stock is derived from components</span>

<span class="go">dolita [10:42 AM]</span>
<span class="go">btw keep this link too: https://urbanfox.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OMS/pages/248053799/Current+Apps+Services+-+as+at+2018+Dec+15</span>

<span class="go">GRN w PO/ GRN without PO/ GRN without PO (scanning)</span>

<span class="go">dolita [12:55 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ok</span>
<span class="go">so for inbound we can do either with PO or without PO</span>
<span class="go">if with PO, only 1 way to receive</span>
<span class="go">use times</span>
<span class="go">that 1 page got 2 ways to access</span>
<span class="go">actually proper way is to scan</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [12:59 PM]</span>
<span class="go">if we have no scan, should we do the item</span>
<span class="go">search to the iventory</span>

<span class="go">dolita [1:00 PM]</span>
<span class="go">if im nt wrong this page doesnt restrict like pick ticket</span>
<span class="go">so everyone can just enter qty</span>
<span class="go">optional</span>
<span class="go">coz it is GRN of a PO, cannot receive more than what is in PO</span>
<span class="go">must be exact</span>
<span class="go">then a PO can have multiple GRN</span>
<span class="go">eg if got 2 items, then item A received first</span>
<span class="go">ppl can come back and receive item B</span>
<span class="go">but in total, the whole GRN summed up cannot exceed PO</span>
<span class="go">(i think WMS might not be bug free here)</span>
<span class="go">the PO must be same as GRN (total)</span>
<span class="go">it is one of the task you doing now</span>
<span class="go">that one select item first</span>
<span class="go">then create GRN right away</span>
<span class="go">no PO one</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [1:05 PM]</span>
<span class="go">i&#39;m okay with PO received</span>
<span class="go">how about the without PO</span>
<span class="go">either of 3 tabls without PO</span>

<span class="go">dolita [1:05 PM]</span>
<span class="go">practically almost all other GRN is no PO</span>
<span class="go">the one at bottom specialy for serial items</span>
<span class="go">zaid used it</span>
<span class="go">nt sure if you remember?</span>
<span class="go">he was scanning a lot times</span>
<span class="go">1 box 2 times</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [1:06 PM]</span>
<span class="go">on the warehouse</span>

<span class="go">dolita [1:06 PM]</span>
<span class="go">yep warehouse</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [1:07 PM]</span>
<span class="go">the first we saw</span>

<span class="go">dolita [1:07 PM]</span>
<span class="go">first scan barcode of item</span>
<span class="go">then scan barcode of serial</span>
<span class="go">that is how system register the relationship of item-serial</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [1:08 PM]</span>
<span class="go">what is this for Goods Receive w/o PO (Scan)</span>

<span class="go">dolita [1:08 PM]</span>
<span class="go">that one as long as you got item with barcode can receive right away</span>
<span class="go">let me demo?</span>
<span class="go">this page got modified</span>
<span class="go">can receive without name address</span>
<span class="go">they want fast receiving you see</span>
<span class="go">as long as got DO# can refer back</span>
<span class="go">you try</span>
<span class="go">either select frm drop down</span>
<span class="go">or scan it</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [1:12 PM]</span>
<span class="go">got it :slightly_smiling_face:</span>
<span class="go">GRN for serialised items/ Picking for serialised item</span>

<span class="go">dolita [1:13 PM]</span>
<span class="go">times dont have serial item</span>
<span class="go">use sennheiser</span>
<span class="go">need to select item with &quot;Item UI&quot; yes</span>
<span class="go">UI here stands for unique identifier</span>
<span class="go">sorry nt select</span>
<span class="go">click go in</span>
<span class="go">need get barcode</span>
<span class="go">serial number is &quot;free&quot;</span>
<span class="go">can you do it again?</span>
<span class="go">just now abcde is input text</span>
<span class="go">but now it is just text</span>
<span class="go">forget why</span>
<span class="go">nvm it is ok</span>
<span class="go">ltr i go thru 1 bug with u + 1 special customer (ryca) (edited)</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [1:18 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ah yes</span>

<span class="go">dolita [1:18 PM]</span>
<span class="go">after yours finish i mean</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [1:19 PM]</span>
<span class="go">so we done with this one?</span>
<span class="go">Adjustment/ Main adjustment</span>

<span class="go">dolita [1:19 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ok</span>
<span class="go">2 ways to adjust</span>
<span class="go">adjustment is to add/deduct qty or transfer item to another location</span>
<span class="go">for eg when they do stock take and realise got disrepancy</span>
<span class="go">it is kind of &quot;grey&quot; area actually</span>
<span class="go">but let us go and see the feature</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [1:21 PM]</span>
<span class="go">so we can add a stock on another location that have an dsirepancy?</span>
<span class="go">transfer</span>

<span class="go">dolita [1:21 PM]</span>
<span class="go">transfer is not grey as in we can move stocks to another location</span>
<span class="go">it is the add or deduct that is grey</span>
<span class="go">coz inbound - outbound = inventory</span>
<span class="go">if always do correctly shld be correct</span>
<span class="go">no need adjust qty</span>
<span class="go">but somehow this is needed</span>
<span class="go">maybe got times items come in but not for inbounding</span>
<span class="go">?</span>
<span class="go">i guess</span>
<span class="go">it is nt used often</span>
<span class="go">but it is still 1 of the impt feature</span>
<span class="go">need pagination there</span>
<span class="go">the option clear?</span>
<span class="go">stock adjust is if want to add or deduct</span>
<span class="go">this page clear?</span>
<span class="go">that page cannot adjust UI (serialised) item (edited)</span>
<span class="go">got a script that auto fetch qty of the exiting location</span>
<span class="go">(just want show u that)</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [1:28 PM]</span>
<span class="go">okay :slightly_smiling_face:</span>
<span class="go">add a quantiyy?</span>

<span class="go">dolita [1:29 PM]</span>
<span class="go">got 2 sku</span>
<span class="go">nv add the top one?</span>
<span class="go">any loc</span>
<span class="go">that shld be clear? you can try transfer?</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [1:30 PM]</span>
<span class="go">yep, I&#39;ll try agaib</span>
<span class="go">we cannot add</span>

<span class="go">dolita [1:32 PM]</span>
<span class="go">the inventory for serial number is like 1 serial 1 line. the traditional adjustment doesnt work with it</span>
<span class="go">that is why i exclude them frm the item list</span>
<span class="go">it will mess up data</span>
<span class="go">so serial items dont have adjustment</span>
<span class="go">if wh ask for it next time, can do</span>
<span class="go">if not, i guess they can live without it for now (edited)</span>
<span class="go">main adjustment</span>
<span class="go">this page very &quot;powerful&quot;</span>
<span class="go">u see it?</span>
<span class="go">typo</span>
<span class="go">can add hundreds of items with just a typo</span>
<span class="go">so very powerful page lol</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [1:36 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ahahha</span>
<span class="go">yes</span>

<span class="go">dolita [1:36 PM]</span>
<span class="go">dangerous</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [1:36 PM]</span>
<span class="go">it is</span>

<span class="go">dolita [1:36 PM]</span>
<span class="go">but got adjustment note</span>
<span class="go">in wms we try to record everything</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [1:38 PM]</span>
<span class="go">got it :slightly_smiling_face:</span>
<span class="go">btw, can we discuss about return and cancel, so I can discuss to akash and ty later</span>

<span class="go">dolita [1:40 PM]</span>
<span class="go">we only gt return btw</span>
<span class="go">dont have cancel</span>
<span class="go">so that will be new thing</span>
<span class="go">can only return frm completed SO</span>
<span class="go">is that test db?</span>
<span class="go">i think someone doing testing</span>
<span class="go">all the SO qty deactivated</span>
<span class="go">(maybe u ask akash ltr)</span>
<span class="go">change to stag db (edited)</span>
<span class="go">up to u?</span>
<span class="go">tick what u want to return (edited)</span>
<span class="go">sometime returned is damaged</span>
<span class="go">so need select accordingly</span>
<span class="go">but i think normally ppl dont do RMA-&gt; gRN right away</span>
<span class="go">coz usually RMA created by cust</span>
<span class="go">GRN done by ops</span>
<span class="go">i show u?</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [1:47 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ah yes</span>

<span class="go">dolita [1:48 PM]</span>
<span class="go">rma created</span>
<span class="go">then ops go there to do receiving</span>
<span class="go">seems like complicated is it</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [1:49 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ah first, hehehe</span>

<span class="go">dolita [1:49 PM]</span>
<span class="go">yep. after u used to it everything &quot;make sense&quot;</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [1:49 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ah yes</span>

<span class="go">dolita [1:50 PM]</span>
<span class="go">got a way to create return nt from SO</span>
<span class="go">but it is not often used</span>
<span class="go">i think some users also dont know got such thing</span>
<span class="go">u want to see?</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [1:51 PM]</span>
<span class="go">the shortcut one</span>

<span class="go">dolita [1:51 PM]</span>
<span class="go">but from thr no record which SO</span>
<span class="go">so we always encourage return via SO</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [1:51 PM]</span>
<span class="go">okay :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

<span class="go">dolita [1:52 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ok</span>
<span class="go">that one</span>
<span class="go">when u do GRN scanning ones</span>
<span class="go">got temporary &amp; immediate right</span>
<span class="go">the temporary is if they want to receive into an area first</span>
<span class="go">but not open for usage</span>
<span class="go">meaning whatever received cannot be used yet</span>
<span class="go">so the inventory record created</span>
<span class="go">qty is in temp_qty</span>
<span class="go">try 4448</span>
<span class="go">nowadays nt used much though</span>
<span class="go">cause the feature not completed</span>
<span class="go">they are the one who use temporary a lot</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [1:54 PM]</span>
<span class="go">got it :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

<span class="go">dolita [1:55 PM]</span>
<span class="go">btw for serial items right, serial numbers can be from factory (like sennheiser)</span>
<span class="go">or it can be from us (if the products usually dont have serial but cust want it)</span>
<span class="go">nowadays nobody use that anymore though</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [1:56 PM]</span>
<span class="go">btw, how about the support issue that I did</span>

<span class="go">dolita [1:56 PM]</span>
<span class="go">u try locate same item</span>
<span class="go">in stag shld still be there</span>
<span class="go">the same item mentioned in support</span>
<span class="go">u ald deactivated</span>
<span class="go">but in stag shld be still active</span>
<span class="go">try open it</span>
<span class="go">that is not BOM?</span>
<span class="go">oh look like they created this week after stag copied</span>
<span class="go">u see the other items</span>
<span class="go">qty 0</span>
<span class="go">can deactivate</span>
<span class="go">u try create new BOM</span>
<span class="go">but once they add component</span>
<span class="go">the component qty will be counted into BOM</span>
<span class="go">(there is a cron script that do the calculation)</span>
<span class="go">so if BOM gt qty cant deactivate</span>
<span class="go">u try kao</span>
<span class="go">and try remove component</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [2:03 PM]</span>
<span class="go">so i deleted the component right?</span>

<span class="go">dolita [2:03 PM]</span>
<span class="go">nope</span>
<span class="go">i was trying to show it is difficult</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [2:03 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ah okay</span>

<span class="go">dolita [2:03 PM]</span>
<span class="go">we need to remove components qty first</span>
<span class="go">then wait for cron to update BOM qty to 0</span>
<span class="go">then can deactivate</span>
<span class="go">if we simply remove component, the cron cannot update the BOM qty</span>
<span class="go">cause component data lost liao</span>
<span class="go">(thats a bug btw)</span>
<span class="go">so it doesnt make sense if we must 0 off components then can deactivate BOM</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [2:05 PM]</span>
<span class="go">that makes sense for now.</span>

<span class="go">dolita [2:05 PM]</span>
<span class="go">i think u help them delete is nt bad</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [2:06 PM]</span>
<span class="go">i mean, we need to wait the sync one to zero components quantity</span>

<span class="go">dolita [2:06 PM]</span>
<span class="go">sync will zero BOM qty</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [2:06 PM]</span>
<span class="go">but in the case that I did, I think its an urgent one</span>
<span class="go">right?</span>

<span class="go">dolita [2:06 PM]</span>
<span class="go">nt very sure</span>
<span class="go">got once i got request to remove bom</span>
<span class="go">https://urbanfox.atlassian.net/browse/OMSS-493</span>
<span class="go">u can experiment</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [2:12 PM]</span>
<span class="go">I just noted down, ehhe</span>
<span class="go">ah sure</span>

<span class="go">dolita [2:14 PM]</span>
<span class="go">hehe</span>
<span class="go">you got keep this link? https://urbanfox.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OMS/pages/248053799/Current+Apps+Services+-+as+at+2018+Dec+15</span>
<span class="go">got mention bom script inside</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [2:16 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ah yes, thank you @dolita :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

<span class="go">dolita [2:18 PM]</span>
<span class="go">i think hard to try in test/ stag cause the script doesnt run in test db</span>
<span class="go">but u can download and execute it locally</span>
<span class="go">lol</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [2:19 PM]</span>
<span class="go">hahaha</span>

<span class="go">dolita [2:19 PM]</span>
<span class="go">need learn how to &quot;hack&quot; stuffs around</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [2:19 PM]</span>
<span class="go">yes yes ahahha</span>
<span class="go">okay lah., hahaha..</span>

<span class="go">dolita [2:19 PM]</span>
<span class="go">are we good ald?</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [2:22 PM]</span>
<span class="go">so per month, eg ( Jan 1)</span>

<span class="go">dolita [2:23 PM]</span>
<span class="go">next one</span>
<span class="go">WMS-201</span>
<span class="go">i didnt manage to trace down the bug</span>
<span class="go">i think i will jus note down in the ticket ok</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [2:25 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ah yes</span>

<span class="go">dolita [2:25 PM]</span>
<span class="go">then next one</span>
<span class="go">WMS-326</span>
<span class="go">i just did this</span>
<span class="go">but the point is we have a user (jumaidi) who use WMS but he is not UF staff</span>
<span class="go">he is ryca staff</span>
<span class="go">and only 1 such scenario</span>
<span class="go">so when jumaidi login, he only see ryca&#39;s account</span>
<span class="go">mmm ok i forgot to update staging</span>
<span class="go">but when he click controller, he see access denied</span>
<span class="go">just note down got such arrangement</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [4:03 PM]</span>
<span class="go">its correct, we have an array items</span>
<span class="go">?</span>

<span class="go">dolita [4:03 PM]</span>
<span class="go">sounds correct but nt sure abt the table</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [4:04 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ah yes</span>

<span class="go">dolita [4:04 PM]</span>
<span class="go">shld be `wms_rma_list` and list item i think (edited)</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [4:06 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ah yes, youre right :slightly_smiling_face:</span>

<span class="go">dolita [4:06 PM]</span>
<span class="go">lol ok</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [4:07 PM]</span>
<span class="go">because I&#39;m confuse,  first when you create an return, 1st query, make a rms record right</span>
<span class="go">then 2nd query, items to be selected `wms_solist_item_rma`</span>
<span class="go">right? (edited)</span>

<span class="go">dolita [4:08 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ah yes</span>
<span class="go">the 2nd query is to get the rma items to be inserted into grn</span>
<span class="go">so for api, shld be `wms_rmalist` and `wms_rmalist_item`</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [4:09 PM]</span>
<span class="go">yep</span>
<span class="go">the `wms_rmalist_item` is the items to be selected right</span>
<span class="go">so we need the items in the request body? (edited)</span>

<span class="go">dolita [4:12 PM]</span>
<span class="go">we sure need items</span>

<span class="go">dolita [4:22 PM]</span>
<span class="go">need give both tables one</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [4:23 PM]</span>
<span class="go">`cos not all items in SO going to be returned ?` definitely yes ?</span>

<span class="go">dolita [4:23 PM]</span>
<span class="go">yea</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [4:27 PM]</span>
<span class="go">`need give both tables one` ?</span>

<span class="go">dolita [4:27 PM]</span>
<span class="go">yea</span>
<span class="go">wms_rmalist cannot exist alone</span>
<span class="go">it always come with wms_rmalist_item</span>

<span class="go">Jasper Carpizo [4:28 PM]</span>
<span class="go">ah yes @dolita</span>

<span class="go">dolita [4:33 PM]</span>
